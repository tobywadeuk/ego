            Ego Development: A Full-Spectrum Theory Of Vertical Growth And
            Meaning Making
          </h1>

          <h3>Prologue</h3>

          <p>
            After many years of promising to write a book on Ego Development
            Theory (EDT for short) and the Leadership Maturity Framework (LMF),
            I decided to begin the process by revising the 9 levels-paper. Of
            all my papers, it is the most cited and the most often required
            reading in college courses in psychology and human development.
            It&rsquo;s high time to revisit the original 9 levels paper in
            regards to argument, content and style. Thus updating it seems like
            a useful first step towards a final, more comprehensive writing
            project. As a non-native speaker of English, clear, concise, and
            convincing writing remains a challenge. I hope this version shows
            some improvements in readability and clarity of reasoning from the
            earlier versions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am also writing this to answer some recurring critics of ego
            development theory by prominent theoreticians because these pertain
            to Loevinger&rsquo;s version, not to the one I have developed since
            the 1980&rsquo;s. Granted I based my original research on
            Loevinger&rsquo;s approach and followed her rigorous requirements
            for testing hypotheses using actual data as a source of new theory.
            Most other theoreticians started out with s &rsquo;s model of how to
            do grounded research and validating one&rsquo;s findings, I soon
            realized some limitations of her theory. It was and still is
            basically describing a sequence of meaning making levels. Each level
            is more complex than the previous one and includes behavioral,
            motivational, cognitive, and emotional components. Yet it does not
            explain what actually happens in development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her theory has no structural underpinnings for why and how people
            develop from one stage to the next. Nor was it sufficiently
            differentiated, in my view, at the high end of the scale. Thus I set
            out to collect new data that would allow for a definition of what
            underlies the movement from stage to stage and to refine the high
            end. In 1985 I first proposed the structure of increasing capacity
            to take perspective on experience (external) and the self (internal)
            at a symposium of the Society for Research in Adult Development.
            http://adultdevelopment.org/ The paper was well received and
            acknowledged as an important contribution and expansion of Loevinger
            theory by participants including Lawrence Kohlberg and Michael
            Commons. They and others encouraged me to continue the research and
            write it up in a paper to be published in the conference
            proceedings. Based on the rare, yet highly suggestive data I had
            collected up to then, I was also able to document two stages to
            replace Loevinger&rsquo;s vague Integrated stage. They provided
            clear criteria that distinguished them qualitatively from earlier
            stages and each other. They followed the overall structure of
            repeating cycles of differentiation and integration into ever larger
            interconnected systems of meaning apparent to the self.
            Self-awareness seems to move from first noticing concrete, external
            features, to traits, to behavior patterns, to awareness of how
            patterns are acquired via cultural conditioning, to seeing
            interrelated systems, and finally, to see through the attempts of
            the ego to codify and explain reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the research was done as an independent scholar, an
            identification that has bountiful benefits and naturally some
            downsides. The beauty of this position is that it has no constraints
            for exploring what peaks one&rsquo;s interest, in what contexts one
            choses to do so, in which form, and how long it takes. There are no
            deadlines, no one to make demands on progress and publishing records
            other than those imposed by oneself. There is also a prize to be
            paid. There is no salary and no academic support. There are no
            semester breaks and sabbaticals, time off when other scholars in
            academia do their writing. Other than reading and attending symposia
            and professional conferences, there is little intellectual exchange
            and challenge. There is also no guaranteed way of making a living
            unless one creates independent work for oneself. Nonetheless, I
            chose to follow the independent scholar path and worked on
            collecting more data and refining the theory and the measuring tool
            for 15 years before I reentered academia to get a doctorate and to
            &ldquo;prove&rdquo; my conjectures as not just figments of my mind.
            By the time I wrote my dissertation, I based my thinking on over
            4500 Sentence Completion Tests or over 130,000 pieces of evidence. I
            joke that I do not recommend that others follow my foot steps for
            their dissertations. It&rsquo;s a piece of writing that many still
            consult both for its thesis and as a research model.
          </p>

          <p>
            I consider it a powerful advantage over Loevinger&rsquo;s knowledge
            of language that I grew up in a multi-lingual society, and was
            trained in linguistics and especially semantics at university in
            Switzerland. Semantics is that branch of linguistics that deals with
            the meaning of words, how new words get created, and how their
            meanings change through the years along with the evolution of
            civilization. Thus, I was primed to pay attention to minute
            differences in usage, context and meaning shifts over time in a way
            that Loevinger&rsquo;s research team was not. As I studied thousands
            of sentence completions, I kept records of interesting examples and
            new potential categories. Initially I added them to enrich and
            sometimes correct Loevinger&rsquo;s manuals. Eventually, our efforts
            became increasingly more complex and different from both the
            original manuals (1970, 1978) and the 1996 revised edition. One can
            certainly write a whole chapter just on the ongoing challenges of
            creating viable test stems and manual revisions. But this is not my
            focus here. What is important is that ego development theory as we,
            at the Center for Leadership Maturity, conceive of it is far more
            comprehensive, dynamic, and complex than Loevinger&rsquo;s original
            contribution to the field. While many people dealing with adult
            development are interested in the high-end of human potential, the
            mature stages and ego-transcendence, my describing of the underlying
            structure of development seems to me just as valuable a
            contribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Worldwide opportunities to teach Ego Development Theory and how to
            do support others&rsquo; well- being and growth by skillfully
            tailoring one&rsquo;s approach to their level of meaning making has
            left me little time to devote to writing. Sharing in person what we
            know about adult development has been work I love. It is also work I
            believe, crucial in understanding our world full of strife and
            clashes among different world views. Knowing about developmental
            differences can shed light on why some of these conflicts are so
            intractable and longstanding, and it invites compassion and hope.
            Helping others who consult, coach and facilitate growth in other
            adults to be aware of their own meaning making preferences as well
            as teaching them to tailor their approach to the capacity of the
            client gives me ongoing pleasure and fulfillment. The request for me
            to write down my reflections on adult development and explicate ego
            development theory has been increasing. The demand also comes from
            within as I grow more white- haired and less physically agile in my
            later years and personal teaching on other continents becomes more
            of a challenge. May this new and expanded version then serve as a
            trial run for writing a full-length book on adult development. The
            book will look at Ego Development Theory and its study from many
            angles. It will likely include the evolution of the theory and my
            current view of development distilled from 35 years of study,
            dialogues with peers, with others of many different persuasions, and
            my own life experience as a researcher, teacher, training
            facilitator and life-long learner. There is so much to share and to
            explore. There are so many questions open about the meaning of being
            a human being, and so much wonder in simply being alive and the
            having of ultimate questions and concerns about life&rsquo;s
            meaning.

            Along with discovering Loevinger&rsquo;s theory, it was Herbert
            Fingarette&rsquo;s (1963) insightful analysis of the synthetic
            function of the ego that first inspired me to turn to the study of
            positive adult development, resilience, and wisdom. Spence&rsquo;s
            Narrative Truth And Historical Truth: Meaning And Interpretation In
            Psychoanalysis (1982) added powerful evidence to my intimation that
            narrative coherence may be more important than actual historical
            truth in people&rsquo;s ability to find meaning in life. Ever since
            I encountered this view, I wondered whether the relationship between
            objective science and the humanities&mdash;and even
            religion&mdash;is analogous: the story we tell about the meaning of
            a given scientific fact perhaps weighs more heavily for our survival
            than its absolute truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego development is a comprehensive theory of meaning making and how
            it evolves from its early beginnings to very mature and integrated
            ways of living one&rsquo;s life and seeing the ego as a necessary
            facet of being a human being with all its powers and limitations. I
            will have to spend focused time in exploring and justifying the
            choice of &ldquo;ego&rdquo; as a viable construct. As a linguist, I
            am as clear as one can be in the world of symbolic representations
            and human discourse that words mean what I assign them to mean. That
            is they have no intrinsic value other than as pointers to
            experience. Especially abstract, psychological terms such as ego,
            self, soul, mind, and purpose serve to label experiences so we can
            talk to each other about them, but they do not actually exist
            separate from the underlying experiential continuum.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <h3>
            Some general tenets of constructive adult developmental theory:
          </h3>

          <p>
            I can say with a good conscience that I have studied other
            people&rsquo;s developmental theories to a degree that few of my
            colleagues have found necessary. An exception is Ken Wilber. In
            Integral Psychology (2000) he offered a comprehensive set of about a
            100 tables that compare both ancient and current theories of
            vertical development with each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            I herewith offer a simple distillation of some of the generally held
            tenets in the field of adult development. In all of my studies, I
            focus on meaning making, not just on the development of cognitive
            complexity and the growth of the mind. This is so because I have
            never observed a healthy human being that is not of one body, heart
            and mind, and spirit if you will. Although modern science has
            enabled us to look at separate variables of any complex2 and explore
            them and describe their properties and dynamics. Nonetheless, we
            experience the world as a whole human being. What changes is how we
            make meaning of ourselves and our experience, and how many different
            aspects of the experience we are conscious of and can pay attention
            to..
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, full-range human development theories share the
            following assumptions:
          </p>

          <p>
            - Development theory describes the ideal unfolding of human
            potential towards deeper understanding, greater love, wisdom and
            effectiveness in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Growth occurs in a logical sequence of stages or expanding world
            views from birth to adulthood. The movement is often likened to an
            ever widening spiral.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Overall, world views evolve from simple to complex, from static to
            dynamic, and from ego-centric to socio-centric to world-centric.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Later stages are reached only by journeying through the earlier
            stages. Once a stage has been traversed, it remains a part of the
            individual’s response repertoire, even when more complex, later
            stages are adopted as primary lenses to metabolize experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Each later stage includes and transcends the previous ones. That
            is, the earlier perspectives remain part of our current experience
            and knowledge (just as when a child learns to run, it doesn’t stop
            to be able to walk).
          </p>
          <p>
            - Each later stage in the sequence is more differentiated,
            integrated, flexible and capable of functioning more adequately in
            our rapidly changing and ever more complex world.
          </p>
          <p>
            - As healthy development unfolds, autonomy, freedom, tolerance for
            difference and ambiguity, resourcefulness as well as flexibility,
            self-awareness, and skill in interacting with the environment
            increase while defenses decrease.
          </p>
          <p>
            - People’s stage of development influences what they notice and can
            become aware of, and therefore, what they can describe, articulate,
            cultivate, influence, and change.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Derailment in development, pockets of lack of integration, trauma
            and psychopathology are seen at all levels. Thus later stages are
            not necessarily more adjusted or “happier.”
          </p>
          <p>
            - A person who has reached a later stage can understand earlier ones
            because they are part of their own becoming, but a person at an
            earlier stage cannot fully understand the later ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The depth, complexity, and scope of what people notice can expand
            throughout life. Yet no matter how evolved we become, our knowledge
            and understanding remain partial and incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Development occurs through the interplay between person and
            environment, not just by one or the other. It is a potential and can
            be encouraged and facilitated by appropriate support and challenge,
            but it cannot be guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>
            - While vertical development can be invited and the environment
            optimally structured towards growth, it cannot be forced. People
            have the right to be who they are at any station in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The later the stage, the more variability for unique
            self-expression exists, and the less readily we can determine where
            a person’s center of gravity lies.
          </p>
          <p>
            - All stage descriptions are idealizations that no human being fits
            entirely.
          </p>

          <h3>The LMF Framework and Ego Development Theory</h3>

          <h3>Constructive, adult development theory and the LMF</h3>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory has come a long way since Jane
            Loevinger&rsquo;s original (1970) and sparse stage descriptions4
            compared to our current understanding of the full trajectory of
            development, and the mechanisms, and patterns of vertical growth in
            the personal realm. We also have learned more about group dynamics,
            family systems, and organizational development. Still these are far
            less well explored than individual adult development.
          </p>

          <p>
            What makes Ego Development Theory unique and different from other
            theories in the field of constructivist developmental approaches is
            its focus on meaning making. Ego Development Theory addresses the
            whole person. It is best understood as a framework that portrays the
            growth of individuals as moving into ever greater awareness and
            integration about both the inner and the outer world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although Ego Development Theory focuses on the development of
            individual awareness, it fully recognizes that there is no
            individual interior development outside a cultural and linguistic
            surround, nor is individual growth possible without the external
            context (historical, geographic, infrastructure, etc.) as it
            supports and constrains what is possible in the interior.

            Ego Development Theory has been developed and refined over at least
            40 years by empirical means unlike almost all other developmental
            approaches6 which first propose a theory, then find appropriate
            means to measure their constructs. Ego Development Theory is a
            grounded theory. It was derived solely based on evidence from
            responses to the sentence completion test or the MAP (Maturity
            Assessment Profile).
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego-development theory postulates that the content and the structure
            of people&rsquo; s language production models their conceptual
            competence, and that the underlying cognitive structure can be
            deduced from a matrix of linguistic signs. It assumes that
            individuals function at the level that is most egosyntonic7 or
            explains the world best to themselves, particularly in areas in
            which they are motivated, such as day-to-day living (see Fischer,
            Hand, &amp; Russell, 1984).
          </p>

          <p>
            At the present time, complex thought and cognition are assumed to be
            testable only if they are expressed through language, the symbolic
            tool with the most widespread consensual validation within a given
            culture.2 Other symbolic systems (pictorial, for instance) may
            express complex thought, but they cannot speculate about it within
            that symbolic frame of reference. It is the metalinguistic
            (self-referral) properties of language that make complex thought and
            its communication possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            I posit that no matter what domain of human consciousness one
            investigates, one&rsquo;s meaning is created and communicated
            through language. Moreover, the assessment of ego maturity, the MAP,
            is predicated on the notion that one&rsquo;s choice of content and
            structure models one&rsquo;s conception of reality.

            Language as a mirror of one&rsquo;s world construction: from chaos
            to cosmos
          </h3>

          <p>
            In terms of Ego Development Theory, language not only
            &ldquo;reflects&rdquo; human experience, but it also organizes and
            filters it. We use the term language to include all symbolic
            representations of one form or another. Natural language seems to be
            the most universally available and sophisticated of the many
            available symbolic representations. To explain and learn other
            systems, we resort to natural language to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
            Several underlying assumptions about human nature will be discussed
            below to establish the role of language in cognition. The
            relationship between language as it structures experience and ego-
            development theory is then drawn through the discussion of the
            methods used to establish ego- development stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            The premise that language is constitutive of experience is a
            cornerstone of ego-development theory. It includes the following
            assumptions about human nature:
          </p>

          <p>
            1. Each human organism is both similar to all others of the species
            and also a unique manifestation of it. All human life is governed by
            the same overall organic systems principle and subject to the same
            &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; such as birth, change, and physical
            death. 2. All human life strives to fulfill the human propensity
            towards both individual differentiation and systematic assimilation
            (see Angyal, 1965, p. 49). At each developmental stage the quality
            and the balance of these two trends have to be renegotiated. 3.
            Humans can only develop into functional adults in a social context.
            One becomes homo sapiens only as one is homo socius. The primary
            socialization is carried out by significant others who transmit the
            culturally accepted orientation and definition of what constitutes
            the reality of everyday life (Berger &amp; Luckman, 1966). The
            primary means of this socialization is language. 4. The human animal
            has a highly sophisticated capacity for the symbolic codification
            and manipulation of experience and, unlike other animals, it can
            become aware of this feat. Natural language is the most fundamental,
            universal, diverse, and flexible of existing codifications. 5. The
            capacity for language acquisition is inherent in the human species.
            A blueprint for language preexists. (See Pinker, 1994, the language
            instinct). As long as the potential for language is activated in
            children through exposure and training in any particular language at
            the maturationally appropriate time, they will acquire it. It will
            become their means for orienting themselves within that cultural
            surround and the basis for continuing cognitive development. On the
            other hand, individuals will not develop language without
            appropriate models. An external catalyst seems to be necessary for
            the particular to emerge out of potentiality. 6. Human beings have
            an intrinsic disposition and need for meaning-making and meaning-
            maintenance. Once a meaning scheme is in place it is constitutive of
            experience and acts as a filter for dissonant stimuli. The
            psychological construct of the &ldquo;ego&rdquo; represents this
            striving of human beings to understand themselves and the world they
            live in through active participation. (Fingarette, 1963) 7.
            Experiences vary in quantity and quality for different individuals
            depending on the circumstances of their being born into a specific
            historical time, geographic place, and linguistic and cultural
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The parameters of the human condition, however, have remained
            constant throughout history and around the globe. It has yet to be
            seen how cyborgs and other electronic life extensions will affect
            these fundamental aspects of being social beings and mortals.
          </p>

          <p>
            1. As a physical organism we are born, grow, change, and die within
            the context of our physical environment. While we live, we need to
            eat, drink, breathe, eliminate waste matter, and sleep. 2. As an
            organism with the capacity for feelings, thought, and the need for
            self-knowledge and knowledge of our world, we depend on a human
            environment with which we are in dialogue for continued growth,
            self-experience, and self-definition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Metaphorically speaking, ego-development theory provides one
            possible account of how individuals navigate the straits of human
            existence by using navigational lore, common sense, increasingly
            complex maps, algorithms, and intuition.
          </p>

          <p>
            A more detailed analysis of the origin and function of language is
            also important because language is so habitual an aspect of our
            behavior that we tend to forget how complex it is and how it
            channels our meaning making. The view of language presented here is
            mainly based on ideas found in general semantics and in research
            investigating the social construction of reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Berger and Luckman, for instance, state that the human organism
            lacks the necessary &lsquo;biological&rsquo; means to survive after
            birth without a human context. The period in which the child
            develops minimal self-sufficiency through interactions with his
            environment is also the period during which the &ldquo;self&rdquo;
            is formed. The individual self cannot be understood apart from the
            particular social and linguistic context in which it was shaped.
            What is to be considered important and real in everyday life is
            transmitted through language and has coercive power over the child
            once it gets inducted into a shared language.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, most of us are amused by a toddler calling a cat or a
            rabbit &ldquo;doggie.&rdquo; We find ourselves subtly correcting our
            children every time they make this &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; until they
            have learned to distinguish dogs from other four-legged animals by
            showing us that they can produce the right label. By about age five,
            children will have acquired a complex linguistic system adequate to
            manipulate abstract concepts, such as time and emotions, and to use
            effectively symbolic sound codifications to interact with others not
            present (e.g., via the telephone). They will also correct a
            two-year-old sibling who exhibits the dog-cat confusion: &ldquo;This
            is not a dog, it&rsquo;s a cat. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            By now, labels appear to children as inherent in the nature of
            things. Any notion of their conventionality or arbitrariness is
            lost. &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; is experienced as consisting of
            distinct, permanent objects with clear boundaries. Knowledge of
            everyday reality as expressed in language has become self-evident,
            automatic, objective, and immutable; that is, reality has been
            reified. Reification or objectification is the process by which we
            attribute &ldquo;real, concrete, material, self-subsistent, or
            separate existence to something that does not have it&rdquo;
            (Basseches, 1984, p. 98).9 And not just children forget about how
            they acquired names for things, most adults do as well and are
            completely unaware of their arbitrary origins.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fact that we swim in symbolic representations from the minute we
            wake to the moment we lay our heads to rest at night is hard to
            fathom for most people. We use language to accomplish a wealth of
            purposes and transactions: from the practical to the fantastic, from
            the ordinary to the sublime. We use language to identify the
            concrete objects and events around us and to tell the stories of our
            group and of ourselves. We also seem to use a shared language to
            assure ourselves and each other of the reality and meaningfulness of
            our existence. Meaningful human existence without language seems
            unimaginable. Even the willed silence of the hermit only means
            something in contrast to clatter and cacophony of the outside world.
          </p>

          <p>
            We cannot overestimate the genius of our capacity for communicating
            and manipulating symbols. Developing language has been vital for the
            evolution of the human species and for its ongoing adaptation.
            Language is likely the most powerful means by which we are
            socialized into a specific overarching view of reality. For
            communication to work there must be some consensus among speakers of
            how a construct or symbol relates to the thing it symbolizes and
            this relationship must be learned by those wanting to participate in
            the collective. A shared language also functions to separate groups
            form each other and insures that specific knowledge and experience
            is transmitted among participants from generation to generation.
          </p>

          <p>
            William James first called the original experience of the child a
            &ldquo;blooming, buzzing confusion&rdquo; (1890, p. 488). In simple
            terms, we are born preverbal, minimally able to sort the onslaught
            of stimuli.11 with our yet untrained senses. Then, if all goes well,
            our senses mature in conjunction with learning to communicate and to
            pay attention to individual things. We also learn a language from
            our caregivers along with names for the things that are important to
            our particular environment.

            Within a few years children communicate, learn and think exclusively
            via symbolic representations (these include sign language) and then
            use them throughout life. That human beings acquire complex language
            is one of the miracles of development in the first place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Are you fully conscious that languages are the product of an
            initially arbitrary segmentation of experience, or the underlying
            undifferentiated field of phenomena according to the needs, creative
            imagination, and resourcefulness of a given language group.
            Languages consist of concrete as well as of increasingly abstract
            objects that serve communication and therefore human survival. Any
            object can be formed only by segmenting a previously undivided
            continuum into separate entities: the object itself, its opposite
            (what it is not), and the background against which it has been
            differentiated. The newly created boundary belongs to all three.
            Each exists through the others only. Any change in one changes the
            others.
          </p>

          <p>
            This can easily be illustrated by cutting one shape (object) out of
            a single undivided piece of paper.
          </p>

          <p>
            We then get three entities: 1) The background, 2) The positive
            cut-out, or the object, 3) The hole or negative space created. If I
            change the outline of the shape, all three parts change. Black only
            exist in contrast to white, hunger to satiation, life to death. All
            of these concepts are interdependent pairs, two side of the same
            coin. Figure: interdependence of polar opposites
          </p>

          <p>
            Labels and their meanings, though arbitrary at first, become
            automatized and institutionalized through repetition and consensus.
            They then serve as unconscious building blocks for further
            distinctions and ramifications. The simplest definitions of what we
            consider tangible objects of everyday life, as well as the most
            complex, abstract, seemingly all-encompassing theories, are based on
            an increasing, elaborate and progressive segmentation of the
            original chaos. The beginning of the Old Testament provides a
            telling example for the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; of the linguistic
            process of progressive segmentation. I paraphrase loosely: In the
            beginning there was the void. Then God divided it into light and
            dark, heaven and earth, etc. Then finally he told Adam to name all
            the creatures and make them under his dominion. The very naming
            makes things &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that can be owned and used.
          </p>

          <p>
            This view of language and cognition is based on the direct
            experience of reality as an undivided unity without boundaries and
            time-space distinctions. It assumes that all manner of objects are
            human inventions or constructs including such abstract notions as
            the ego and the self. Another way of saying this is that all objects
            and labels are abstractions, &ldquo;pulled out of&rdquo; the
            underlying seamless reality. Abstraction comes from the Latin
            AB-STRAHERE meaning to pull out .
          </p>

          <p>
            With every speech act, the members of a language community mutually
            reinforce the shared conceptual map or worldview for each other. By
            the time we are in school, we are so deeply habituated into
            language, we cannot imagine life without it. We generally can
            remember neither our own preverbal existence, nor how we acquired
            our mother tongue. For most people, the language habit remains
            unconscious and automatic throughout their lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fortunately, the potential for language is innate (Chomsky, 1965;
            Pinker, 1994). As long as that potential is activated in children
            through regular exposure and training at the maturationally
            appropriate age, they acquire a specific language and hence will
            structure experience via its grammar and concepts. Developing more
            sophisticated language then becomes a central basis for continuing
            development within a given speech community. The cognitive growth
            that accompanies children&rsquo;s physical maturation can be
            described as a process of continuous acquisition of finer and finer
            symbolic representations, elaborations, and distinctions. This also
            includes organizing existing concepts into higher orders of
            abstraction or of bundling them into umbrella categories. The more
            evolved and mature, the more &ldquo;territories of experience&rdquo;
            (Torbert, 1991, p. 60) become available for symbolic representation
            and cognitive manipulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just as different cultures segment the continuum in different ways,
            so different individuals perceive a slightly different segment of
            the stimuli continuum, depending on the microstructure of their
            specific bodies (including genetic variables) and their development.
            They accept stimuli for processing both according to their innate
            general human makeup, their unique personal constitution, and
            according to the linguistic screens and limitations imposed on them
            by their culture. I assume that we are inevitably shaped by both the
            language instinct (nature) and the language habit (nurture).
          </p>

          <p>
            It seems reasonable to conclude that in order to grow into adults,
            human beings are initially dependent on a &ldquo;culturally&rdquo;
            accepted orientation, and definition of what is real in life. Once a
            coherent view of reality is absorbed, it is constitutive of
            experience and filters out rivaling possibilities. As Rheingold put
            it: &ldquo;Although it is rarely visible to us, we carry around in
            our heads a conceptual map of the world, a guidebook to rightness
            and wrongness, ugliness and beauty, value and worthlessness&rdquo;
            (1988, p. 72). Such mental maps seem indispensable because they
            provide us with rules and scripts for action, and explanations of
            why things are the way they are. Moreover, they often rationalize,
            justify, and sometimes even sanctify our existence.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will say more about how this plays out in developmental terms
            later when I summarize postconventional ego development. For now, I
            will point out that becoming aware of one&rsquo;s acculturation
            marks a turning point in development. Once individuals understand
            that they are interpreters of reality, that they contribute their
            own meaning to external and internal &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; and that
            their insight may differ markedly from generally held definitions of
            what things mean, their explanatory universe has changed
            dramatically. They have become aware of the inevitability of
            cultural conditioning and programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a step beyond relativism, people can become aware of the deeper
            discursive bias inherent in the construction of the object world via
            language. They realize that the objects themselves are inventions,
            arbitrary but useful for orientation. This includes an ever-growing
            awareness of the process and mechanism of thinking and meaning
            making themselves. In ego development, the experience of the
            limitation of the concept of &ldquo;ego&rdquo; and the need for its
            transcendence become central existential tasks at in the most mature
            stages of postconventional development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once one realizes that the universe itself has no boundaries, no
            objects, no causality, no time and space (Koplowitz, 1984), one has
            to face one&rsquo;s intrinsic need to organize
            experience&ndash;one&rsquo;s need to make cosmos out of chaos by
            attributing order, relevance, and meaning to it. Seeking a way of
            experiencing and meaning making that is direct - without the filter
            of language - can become a central existential quest.
            Ego-development theory&mdash;if it is to be viable explanatory
            principle&mdash;must be able to account for the transcendence of the
            self at the high-end of the trajectory. In our view only a theory
            that includes awareness of our symbolic embeddedness can offer an
            argument that can account for this extraordinary phenomenon without
            resorting to spiritual explanations.

          <p>
            I will later argue in more detail that the experience of the
            artificiality of such concepts as the &ldquo;ego&rdquo; occurs at
            the most mature stages of development. For now, I offer this
            summary: Each culture divides the original, unstructured continuum
            in different ways (Hall, 1966) according to its specific needs,
            development, and inventiveness well as its context. Labels and their
            meanings, though arbitrary at first, become institutionalized and
            automatized through repetition and consensus. They then serve as
            unconscious building blocks for further distinctions and
            ramifications. The simplest definitions of what we consider tangible
            objects of everyday life as well as the most complex, abstract,
            seemingly all- encompassing theories based on a progressing
            elaborate segmentation of the original chaos partake in this process
            of objectification. The need for meaning drives people to integrate
            into their existing conceptual frames of reference every difference
            that enters awareness by either labeling it or filtering it out.
            Persistent discrepancies that cannot be accommodated through
            horizontal integration or defensive mechanisms may induce a
            restructuring of the previous framework (mindset) into a more
            coherent new whole. Ego-development theory attempts to account for
            these changes in perspective by proposing a sequence of hierarchical
            invariant ego stages.

            Ken Wilber&rsquo;s AQAL model of human consciousness evolution and
            Ego Development Theory.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Loevinger developed her Ego Development Theory in the late
            1950&rsquo;s as part of the human potential movement in psychology
            to find out what healthy adult development might looks like. This
            effort was in part a reaction to the first half of the 20th century
            which focused heavily on psychopathology and the many ways growth
            can get stunted and development derailed. If you read her original
            sentence completion stems, you can clearly hear the Freudian
            undertones. Our current instrument, the MAP, has far fewer stems
            related to upbringing and family issue though we do keep some
            because of their essential importance in all human beings.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Wilber&rsquo;s integral theory, Loevinger&rsquo;s
            theory and Ego Development Theory as we conceive of it is situated
            in his upper left (UP) quadrant because both deal with an
            individual&rsquo;s interior.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here, a brief summary of the main point of Integral or AQAL theory:
            AQ stands for All Quadrants and describes at least four irreducible
            perspectives (subjective, intersubjective, objective, and
            interobjective). These must be considered when attempting to fully
            study or understand any issue or aspect of reality including human
            nature and meaning making (Cook-Greuter, 2006). Thus, the quadrants
            differentiate between 1) an inside and an outside perspective and 2)
            between a singular and plural perspective, that is between two basic
            polarities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The four quadrants also represent dimensions of reality that exist
            simultaneously. For instance, all individuals (including animals)
            have some form of subjective experience and intentionality, or
            interiors, as well as various behaviors and physical components, or
            exteriors that can be observed and described. It is clear that human
            infants cannot survive in isolation. They need to be raised by
            members of a group and learn its language, shared scripts, beliefs,
            and values. The shared e represent the interior of a given
            collective. We refer to these also as intersubjective cultural
            realities. In turn, no society can function without ecological and
            social systems that organize life in the community. These usually
            include established systems and institutional structures of
            minimally forms of commerce, housing, energy, governance, law,
            politics, education, and religion. In English, these four dimensions
            are represented by four basic pronouns: &ldquo;I&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;it&rdquo;, and &ldquo;its.&rdquo; Each
            pronoun represents one of the domains in the quadrant model:
            &ldquo;I&rdquo; represents the individual interior (consciousness).
            &ldquo;We&rdquo; represents the collective interior (culture).
            &ldquo;It&rdquo; represents the individual exterior (Behavior). And
            &ldquo;Its&rdquo; represents the collective exterior (Systems). 15
          </p>

          <p>
            The four quadrants are also associated with first-, second-, and
            third-person perspectives reflecting the philosophical values of
            goodness, beauty and truth. What constitutes beauty is deeply
            subjective. Goodness has to do with how we treat each other and is
            an aspect of intersubjective agreements. Truth belongs to the domain
            of what is objectively verifiable. These same three domains have
            also been characterized as a) aesthetics, morals, and science, and
            b) consciousness, culture, and nature. They are discernable in all
            major languages through pronouns that represent first-, second-, and
            third-person perspectives and are referred to by Wilber as
            &ldquo;the Big Three:&rdquo; I, We, and It/s.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory also talks about 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person
            perspectives (as well as 4th and 5th, and nth person perspectives)
            but uses these ordinal numbered perspectives to mean something else.
            We are referring to the increasing altitude from which one can look
            at oneself and at one&rsquo;s meaning making which can be
            demonstrated by the perspective one can take and is diagrammed as
            follows:

            oneself
          </p>

          <p>
            Much more will be explained later on in the separate chapters about
            each stage of development. It is important here to point out the
            potential confusion with how these terms are used in Wilber and in
            Action Inquiry (Torbert et alt. 2004). There they refer to a
            research method that advocates the interplay of the &ldquo;I, we,
            and it&rdquo; perspectives. In that context what is referred to as
            perspectives generally means the following: First person (my
            individual view and experience), second person (our shared dialogue,
            beliefs and conventions), and third person (the explicit objective
            and scientific study of a topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            AL in AQAL stand for All Levels since all spheres of experience also
            show vertical development over time. Ego development occupies the
            Upper Left in Ken Wilber&rsquo;s model. It explores the individual,
            interior growth of self-awareness. While the focus of the theory is
            on the individual interior, it fully recognizes that individuals
            only develop in dynamic interactions with self and others, language,
            culture and external givens and conditions. In Integral Psychology,
            Wilber (2000) describes the most common levels of development found
            in current Western society. More importantly for the field, he lists
            about a 100 versions of developmental notions from the distant past
            and from across the globe to current theories of human development
            in the appendix of Integral Psychology. The observation that humans
            change over the life span is ancient and is best known in its
            rudimentary form as the riddle of the Sphinx: What walks on 4 legs,
            2 legs, and 3 legs?
          </p>

          <p>
            According several sources the metaphor of the iceberg works
            especially well to highlight the distinction between the quadrants
            that are visible exterior and objective from those that are mostly
            invisible, and subjective, intangible, i.e. below the surface.
          </p>

            <img src="3.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            The table below shows how Ego Development Theory ranges over the
            main waves of development as elaborated by Wilber: It covers the
            preconventional, conventional, postconventional and early post-
            postconventional (or ego-transcendent) ways of meaning making. The
            comparison table is meant to give a sense of both the fine-tuned
            differentiations in Ego Development Theory and its overall fit
            within the integral model. Despite the appearance of this diagram,
            the theory is not to be seen as a simple hierarchy, or a stair-case
            like sequence of clearly separated levels which describe all human
            beings.
          </p>

            Spirituality

          <p>
            <img src="4.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            Using tiers in the table above (or what looks like rungs on a
            ladder) is just one common way of how developmental models can be
            represented and displayed. There are other useful ways of depicting
            vertical growth including the spiral and the arch (see Figure xxx
            and xxx respectively). According to my understanding of the nature
            of symbolic representations, all mathematical models, diagrams and
            figures are abstractions. They help to explain specific and partial
            aspects of the underlying experience, but they each have their
            unique limitations. Thus, multiple representations of the same
            phenomenon give a better approximation of what we are charting than
            any one by itself. Still, it deserves repeating, none of the
            theories and their visual representations can do justice to the
            complexity and mystery of living in human form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let me reiterate another important point. Not just Ego Development
            stages are idealizations, the levels identified by other researchers
            are as well. The differences occur because different scholars focus
            on different aspects of the human experience and behavior. Ego
            Development Theory describes the ideal outcome of healthy
            development for each increase in perspective taking and integration
            at a higher altitude. No individual fits all aspects of these
            descriptions. The sequence serves as a road map, as a way for
            individuals to orient themselves about how they currently see
            reality and themselves. This roadmap is based on empirical evidence
            about how self-identity evolves over time. It shows what individuals
            at a given stage have already mastered, what characterizes their new
            level and likely meaning making now, and what their growth edge and
            potential for further unfolding might be towards greater maturity
            and wisdom. Though helpful, the roadmap is not writ in stone as
            people travel through life in many different and meaningful ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, we find as a rule that the later the stage, the more
            varied ways there are to embody a particular framing of reality as
            more and more capacities and resources come on board. The image of a
            widening spiral is often used to indicate the increasing breadth.
            Moreover, nobody is at one or another stage 100%. Although a person
            may test as having his or her center of gravity at a specific stage,
            we always see a distribution of responses over at least 3 levels.
            Wide distributions over 5 to 6 stages are not uncommon. The shape of
            the distribution can be more informative about a person&rsquo;s
            current propensities and potential for further growth than the final
            MAP score by itself. Most people show a trailing and a growth edge
            around their center of gravity with lesser tails also often part of
            the distribution. We consider the trailing or secondary stage as a
            place people employ or fall back to under duress or because is it
            functional for certain demands of everyday life. The growth edge can
            indicate to what degree an individual is in transition to a new
            understanding of reality.
          </p>

          <h3>General Aspects of Ego Development Theory</h3>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory currently maps nine levels of increasing
            embrace16, a phrase we have used in earlier version of a white paper
            outlining the characteristics of the stage sequence. Each level or
            stage represents a distinct, qualitatively different, uniquely
            defined, and increasingly complex view of self and reality. As
            indicated below, we define two preconventional, three conventional,
            three postconventional, and one postpostconventional or
            ego-transcendent stage. The last stage is a catch-all stage for what
            is likely several more distinct levels in human consciousness
            evolution. Since the theory is based on empirical data from a
            sentence completion test, the method itself created a constraint as
            the short verbal stimuli rarely elicit ego-transcendent responses.
            At the time of my first data collection (1980-1995) there were not
            enough Unitive stage completions to make finer distinctions at the
            ego- transcendent level. Although we have gathered again as much
            data overall since then, I still don&rsquo;t see enough new
            distinguishing markers to describe further differentiations on the
            growth trajectory. 17
          </p>

          <h3>Naming the stages</h3>

          <p>
            Since we have adopted Torbert&rsquo;s 18well-known stage labels used
            in business and non-academic contexts, we list them below for
            comparison and ease of reference. Depending on the audience, we use
            either set of terms. In our observation, two stages (Stages 2/3 and
            4/5) express the same underlying structure of meaning in two
            significantly different ways.19 The difference is not obvious in
            Torbert&rsquo;s labels, thus we use both Loevinger&rsquo;s and his
            to more adequately reflect the different forms of self- expression.
            We also see two different foci in the postautonomous Stage 5/6,
            although they seem more sequential than two equal expressions of the
            same mindset. We use the term Unitive throughout for the latest
            stage in our theory because Torbert&rsquo;s respective label, the
            Ironist, is regularly misunderstood and creates questions to what it
            actually means and how it relates to ego-development.20
          </p>

          <p>
            When doing research we prefer Loevinger&rsquo;s more scientific
            terms with one exception. She called the Expert stage 3/4 (her I
            3/4, E5) Self-aware. There is little self-awareness present at this
            level as the conscious, separate psychological self is just being
            discovered. Self-conscious as a stage name expresses the
            characteristic of this level far better than Loevinger&rsquo;s
            choice of &ldquo;self-aware&rdquo; as the individuals labor to find
            and define their own identity and are quickly defensive when they
            don&rsquo;t feel seen. Overall, we also adopted Loevinger&rsquo;s
            practice to spell the stage names with capital letters to
            distinguish them from their same-sounding adjectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="5.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            Choosing labels for the stages has turned out to be one of the
            thorniest issues across the field of adult development. Ideally
            labels give a hint of what is characteristic of a given stage yet
            without adding associations that lead to misconstruing them. An
            example in our case is the label Expert for the Self- conscious
            Stage 3/4.21 Being at the Expert stage does not mean that one is
            necessarily an expert in anything. It is more a description of the
            held values and the self-identity that is defined by them.
          </p>

          <h3>Metaphors we live by</h3>

          <p>
            At CLM we use the terms &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;later&rdquo; in discussing stages to counteract the subtle
            bias of the value-ridden terms &ldquo;higher&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;lower&rdquo; which belong to our embodied metaphors.
            &ldquo;Higher&rdquo; is inevitably perceived as better because from
            grades, to quality descriptions it does mean &ldquo;better.&rdquo;
            Notice also the specific sequencing of terms, higher comes first.
            Once one starts thinking about embodied metaphors in everyday speech
            one is amazed at their insidious and subtle influence on meaning. We
            do use the designations &ldquo;higher and lower,&rdquo; however, in
            constructive developmental research contexts and statistical
            analyses because this is the convention for science. Let me give you
            one more telling example from our field. That higher is better is
            also part of the vertical versus horizontal growth distinction.
            Bodies that are vertical or upright, that is, they are up and
            standing while those who are horizontal are dead or at least lying
            down, a much less vigorous &ldquo;stance.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <h3>Directionality</h3>

          <p>
            Human development can be described in many ways although most
            current theorists see it as evolving in a spiral fashion. With
            increasing growth and maturity, the spiral broadens to include new
            information and cognitive capacities as well as new ways of seeing
            the self. At each level, old experiences and dilemmas are being
            reworked and mastered in new ways. From a constructivist
            perspective, what changes are not the basic challenges that human
            beings encounter in life, but the relationship to these challenges
            that a person can have. Similar topics are revisited yet approached
            with increasing capacity for perspective taking and with more
            resources available to deal with them. Wilber coined the felicitous
            phrase that perfectly summarizes this notion: &quot;it hurts more,
            but bothers you less.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite the overall evolutionary directionality of development,
            individuals move in all directions as indicated in the Figure xxx
            below: Adult meaning makers may remain in a steady state or in a
            plateau for a number of years or even for a life time. They may
            expand horizontally and add new capabilities at the same level they
            are already inhabiting. They may transform vertically to new ways of
            seeing reality. And they can regress to earlier meaning making
            stages.

            development

          <p>
            The MAP-test identifies the center of gravity. We define the center
            of gravity as that level of ego maturity to which a person has
            consistent access to under ordinary circumstances without special
            support conditions23 or without unusual stress. In other words, the
            measured ego maturity stage is the one that a person reliably and
            routinely uses in response to everyday life. At the same time, we
            have never encountered a distribution of responses that was narrower
            than three levels. Often responses span over four, five and rarely
            over the whole range of possibilities. Indeed, for healthy, advanced
            ego development we expect flexible access to a broad range of
            responses across the stages, not just late- stage material.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most growth in adulthood seems to occur within a given stage,
            variously described as lateral or horizontal development or
            &ldquo;translation&rdquo; in Wilber&rsquo;s terminology. The current
            way of viewing the self and reality is refined, enriched, and
            modified to include more diverse domains, more contexts and detail,
            and to establish more connections among them. We learn new skills,
            new methods, new facts, even new ways of organizing knowledge. The
            later the stage, the more room for such horizontal expansion exists
            while the current stage or mental model of the world remains the
            same
          </p>

          <p>
            Although rarer, upward vertical development can occur throughout
            life. In that case, the whole previous meaning system is transformed
            and restructured into a new, more expansive and inclusive
            self-theory and theory of the world. It is estimated that it takes
            about five years to move to a new level if circumstances are
            favorable and the person is open to change. It takes minimally a
            year of a well- designed developmental program for some participants
            to shift to a new level. A very well-written study by Manner and
            Durkin (2004) has convincingly shown that interventions need to be
            targeted a step or two above those for whom they are designed.
            Otherwise there is little change. Even if we see gains in ego
            maturity, we can never know whether it was the well-conceived
            program that promoted vertical development or one of the many other
            factors that support growth in adults. Being already on the cusp of
            transformation, that is starting the program already in transition,
            major life events, or simply the innate potential for growth can
            also prompt vertical movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory is a theory of self- identity and how it
            forms and changes over time. It includes horizontal development as
            well as the potential transformation from one view of reality to a
            broader, more inclusive one. It describes a sequence of how
            people&rsquo;s mental models of reality evolve. Each new level
            contains the previous ones as a subset. This is best illustrated
            with a set of Russian dolls, where each doll contains another,
            smaller doll. Thus, each new level is both a new whole with its own
            coherence, and &ndash; at the same time -- also a part of a larger,
            more complex system.

          <h3>Coping strategies including defenses</h3>

          <p>
            For continuing growth, both support and challenge from the
            environment seem to be necessary. It is important to acknowledge the
            powerful means we have to resist growth when challenges seem
            overwhelming. As part of the psychological make-up, human beings
            have developed defenses that help us manage threats from both
            external and internal sources. Some defenses derive from the
            reptilian brain in response to physical threats or perceived threats
            to existence such as the flight, fight or freeze reflexes. Other
            defenses are more psychological such as, for example, denial,
            projection and rationalization as responses to more emotional and
            mental disturbances. Defenses are vital for survival and for coping
            with stressors. They tend to become deeply and viscerally anchored
            in our behavior as unconscious habits. Sullivan (1953) defined
            defense mechanisms as a way to screen out phenomena that do not fit
            people&rsquo;s already existing views of reality. Even when we
            become conscious of challenges to our way of seeing things, we can
            often filter them out by selective inattention. In Loevinger
            inimitable words, &ldquo;the ego maintains its stability, its
            identity, and its coherence by selectively gating out observations
            inconsistent with its current state &ndash; granting that one
            person&rsquo;s coherence is another person&rsquo;s gibberish.&rdquo;
            (Hy &amp; Loevinger, 1996, p. 4).
          </p>

          <p>
            When our current meaning making system is disturbed, we tend to deny
            or ignore the intrusion in order to remain safely with what we know.
            The greater the perceived threat, the more we may cement our current
            way of seeing things by actively denying or rejecting it or by
            simply not paying further attention to it. While denying that
            something threatening is perceived may be maladaptive, putting it on
            the back burner, so to speak for later processing, can be an
            adaptive move. But life urges us again and again to solve
            disorienting dilemmas and discrepancies by responding with an
            enlarged and broader perspective that allows the issue to be solved
            at a new level of understanding. As Einstein declared,
            &ldquo;Problems cannot be solved at the same level that created
            them.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            When the choice is between safety and risk, we can either open up to
            the unknown and explore it despite the anticipated discomfort or
            remain closed. We often operate under the false assumption that it
            is better to stay with what we know than to face the unknown even if
            the status quo is not ideal or outright toxic. While Sullivan
            defined some of the defense mechanisms, George Vaillant (1993) first
            saw their potential as means for coping and described the preferred
            defenses along the ego development journey. In general, the later
            the stage, the lesser the need for defensive maneuvers, that is, for
            experience to be different than it is. Ego Development theory
            predicts that different stages of maturity will have different
            capacities and choices regarding defenses.
          </p>

          <h3>Suffering and development</h3>

          <p>
            What I am not claiming is that suffering is a prerequisite for
            transformation, yet it often accompanies the move to a new level.
            The crucible of loss of loved ones, serious illness, disasters and
            other &ldquo;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&rdquo; are all
            potential levers for reorienting and restructuring our understanding
            of ourselves and the world. Fear of the as-yet-unknown can hold us
            back from unfolding. Defending against life&rsquo;s challenges can
            get us stuck. Many of the defenses serve to protect us against
            imagined or anticipated pain by conscious deselection or unconscious
            habit. Yet not fully engaging in life&rsquo;s ongoing challenges
            constitutes another form of suffering. It was famously summarisedby
            Henry David Thoreau as &ldquo;the mass of men lead lives of quiet
            desperation.&rdquo; Ongoing development requires that we say
            &ldquo;yes! to life&rdquo; again and again and again.
          </p>

          <p>
            All major change can create anxiety as we are habit creatures.
            Growth includes the unknown, sometimes intimated to some degree,
            other times utterly unimaginable. While possibly exciting, stage
            change is also likely accompanied with considerable discomfort,
            pain, loss, and uncertainty. Most aspects of living include
            relationship to other people &ndash; people who may be attached to
            the familiar way we were and who wish us to remain
            &ldquo;familiar.&rdquo; Moreover, our own strongly held values have
            to be renegotiated when we enter a new view of reality. To put in
            sharp relief, we assert here that with each transformation we are
            actually entering a new reality with its own rules, patterns, and
            language.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this reason, the relationship to almost any concept can be shown
            to differ along the developmental path. A person&rsquo;s
            understanding of power, feedback, time, love, integrity and truth,
            for instance, changes with increasing development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although we observe the use of more mature defenses along the
            developmental spiral, maladjustments and pathologies of all kinds
            are possible throughout the course of life. We have found
            narcissistic tendencies to show up at all stages, but especially in
            highly differentiated, articulate, and otherwise discerning
            individuals who hold positions of power in their arenas of
            influence. Given the ego&rsquo;s need to assert itself, it is not
            surprising that superior intelligence and the holding of more
            enlightened values can create a sense of entitlement. However, we
            notice that the capacity to notice and let go of even one&rsquo;s
            most cherished assets -- which include access to complex reasoning
            and transpersonal insights -- is directly related to one&rsquo;s ego
            maturity and self-awareness.
          </p>

          <h3>
            The Language Habit and its Centrality in Measuring Ego Maturity
          </h3>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory was built on and relies on the observation
            that the meaning making capacity of individuals is reflected in
            their language. We find again and again that the later the stage,
            the ever more subtle distinctions people can make. At the same time
            they can also &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; experiences into more abstract
            and overarching concepts. See my thesis on Comprehensive Language
            Awareness (1995). It provides the rationale for why I believe this
            is so.
          </p>

          <p>
            It stands to reason, that changes in language over time inevitably
            influence what people will be able to address in response to
            sentence beginnings. The MAP therefore has to respond to and
            integrate changes in cultural shifts, language patterns and new
            concepts (memes). The manuals that are the cornerstone for measuring
            ego development thus also have to develop and reflect such changes.
            This is regrettably so from the perspective of the market place as
            well as in the eyes of those who want certainty and stability in
            psychometrics. While we continue to argue that a developmental
            measure itself has to be adaptable to the changing cultural and
            linguistic currents and the actual evidence gathered, we are aware
            of the potential disadvantage of holding this view. The world of
            psychometricians prefers variables to remain static, immutable and
            repeatable over long periods of time. Just look at the MBTI which
            has been shown to have marginal validity, yet is a measure used
            world-wide. This is not all bad news because, like the Enneagram, it
            seems to support people in expanding their appreciation and
            tolerance for personality differences in themselves and others.
          </p>

          <h3>Social discourse as changing over time</h3>

          <p>
            What once may have been an indicator of a certain later level of
            development because of its erstwhile rare occurrence -- such as
            referring to diversity or equality -- has become part of the common
            parlance of many people. Because there are now laws about gender
            equality and diversity, people at all levels pay at least lip
            service to them at work and in response to trigger stems that
            address men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s roles on the MAP. The
            historical-cultural perspective is additional reason why we are more
            cautious about associating particular values with particular levels.
            Formerly later stage concepts have been adopted in all kinds of
            contexts at various levels of understanding. To wit, references to
            spiritual growth24 are now part and parcel of the advertising
            industry. Reams of self-help books and programs promise quick
            success in attaining spiritual awakening.
          </p>

          <h3>Structure and content, a vital distinction</h3>

          <p>
            Constructive developmental theories distinguish between structure
            and content. Structure looks at the way a person responds to life,
            at what objects appear in their awareness, and how they frame that
            awareness. Content refers to the choice of topics and concepts a
            person mentions. Looking for deep and surface structure is another
            way of expressing this distinction. Ego Development Theory
            postulates that almost any concept can be looked at through a
            developmental lens from feedback, to intimacy, to power, to specific
            values. What a particular concept or value means depends on the user
            and his or her relationship or view of a it. It is for this reason,
            that we delegate &ldquo;values&rdquo; often to the content category
            as they do not tell us how a person enacts a given value only what
            they espouse. Chris Argyris (1977) introduced the important
            distinction between &ldquo;espoused theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;theory
            in action.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            What I declare as my value can take many different forms of
            enactment. For example, I can tell you that I am an animal lover who
            hates the idea of animals being caged and experimented with for any
            reason. I can then act upon this value in various ways. I can free
            monkeys from a medical animal lab by destroying the lab and even
            killing people who tend the facility. I can do research on how to
            better respond to the animals&rsquo; emotional and physical needs in
            research labs. I can work on and change the legal system to ensure a
            reasonable treatment of such animals. I can go on the barricades and
            publicly protest but do so with peaceful means. I can also be a
            person who can balance the need for such research, with the need to
            treat animals with respect and care, and to minimize their use only
            if there is no other way to find answers to a medical issue. Ego
            development looks at what a person feels or thinks is right action
            in response to a given value they hold and what actions they take to
            express the value.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far I have covered how Ego Development Theory fits into the
            overall field of constructive developmental theory, and argued for
            the centrality of language in evaluating people&rsquo;s meaning
            making. I also offered some distinctions and general observations
            relevant to understanding Ego Development Theory. In the following I
            will address the central concept of &ldquo;ego&rdquo; in Ego
            Development Theory and its functions. The detailed descriptions of
            the stages and their sequential emergence then make up the bulk of
            this essay.
          </p>

          <h3>Ego Development proper</h3>

          <h3>The concept of Ego</h3>

          <p>
            Some aspects of Loevinger&rsquo;s and my use of the term ego and
            Kegan&rsquo;s &ldquo;self&rdquo; seem similar to Freud&rsquo;s
            superego (e.g. the development of impulse control, managing
            affective states, and conflict resolution). However, I use the term
            &ldquo;ego&rdquo; here to denote the underlying principle in
            personality organization that strives for coherent meaning and
            orchestrates how we perceive reality. &ldquo;Ego development is the
            term for the common element in the stage sequence and the
            corresponding dimension of individual differences&rdquo; (Loevinger,
            1993, p. 6).
          </p>

          <p>
            I use the term self interchangeably with person and individual
            whereas by ego, I distinguish two functions: ego as process and ego
            as representation (see Funk, 1994, p. 15) The ego as process is the
            more unique conception. The ego as representation (the I and the me
            as one&rsquo;s identity) is a result of the synthetic, integrative
            function of the ego. It describes how one&rsquo;s understanding of
            self and one&rsquo;s identity develops over time according to a set
            pattern. The created identity thus changes with the changing levels
            of integration. Interestingly, rare high-end SCTs seem to reflect
            the possibility of becoming a witness to both the ego&rsquo;s
            efforts at processing and to the changing results of the process of
            &ldquo;identity formation.&rdquo; The fundamental arbitrariness and
            limits of defining and reifying experience were introduced earlier
            and will be taken up again as a separate theme in the validation
            study.
          </p>

          <h3>Ego as the storyteller</h3>

          <p>
            I have introduced the notion that all terms we use are initially
            arbitrary, then become common coinage by consensus and usage. The
            term &ldquo;ego&rdquo; is no different. It isn&rsquo;t a real thing
            that we can point to. It&rsquo;s a term we use in our culture for
            something that we agree can be felt in a psychological sense,
            something that operates in us. It common speech and in some
            spiritual schools &ldquo;ego&rdquo; is referred to as something bad
            as it is associated with egotism or self-centeredness.25 When used
            in that way, ego needs to be curbed, brought under control, left at
            the door or even destroyed. Yet as simply a psychological concept it
            can be researched and its function understood and shared. Thus, a
            clear definition of what we mean by it in this context is essential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on Loevinger&rsquo;s practice, Ego Development Theory uses the
            term &ldquo;ego&rdquo; as the central and overarching concept. She
            translated Freud&rsquo;s &ldquo;ich&rdquo; as ego. According to
            Loevinger, it is ego&rsquo;s function to ceaselessly interpret
            experience and to try to make coherent sense of it. If you prefer
            the hard sciences, you can think of ego as the central processing
            unit. If liberal arts are more your style, ego as the story teller
            names it well. Ken Wilber talks about the self-system (a term
            introduced by Sullivan), which is a very similar notion to ego as
            the story teller, or the metabolizer, and integrator of everything
            that appears in consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loevinger (1976) in her major theoretical contribution on ego
            development cites Fingarette (1963) as one of her sources for
            defining the ego. He first characterized the ego as the psychic
            organizing function or the synthetic principle in meaning making. He
            postulated that the psychological construct of the &ldquo;ego&rdquo;
            is at the core of creating and maintaining a coherent world view. He
            defined the ego as &ldquo;the autonomous drive towards meaning
            making&rdquo; (p. 86). The ego represents the striving of human
            beings to understand themselves and the world they live in by
            fitting new experiences into their current meaning system. Overall,
            the ego labors continuously to create and maintain coherence and it
            vigorously defends against dissonant stimuli.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fingarette concluded that when the ego fails in its mandate to
            create meaning, humans suffer anxiety, which is the dread of
            non-being or a basic sense of meaninglessness. Thus the ego is at
            the very core of meaning making, constantly integrating and
            absorbing experience and classifying and finding order in everything
            that touches the individual both externally and internally.
          </p>

          <p>
            We agree with Fingarette and Loevinger that &ldquo;the search for
            coherent meanings in experience is the essence of the ego or of ego
            functioning, rather than just one among many ego functions. The ego
            maintains its stability, its identity, and its coherence by
            selectively filtering out observations inconsistent with its current
            state. In other words, Ego Development Theory tells us something
            about how a person interprets whatever they are conscious of and can
            take as object. We postulate that the ego is the meaning maker or
            story teller par excellence, or whatever name we choose to give this
            force in us. It selects, orchestrates, integrates, and metabolizes
            experience throughout life. It also exerts its influence all the way
            up in vertical terms into the transpersonal realm. What changes is
            the relationship of individuals to their &ldquo;ego.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            In summary, Ego Development Theory is a theory about meaning making.
            Making sense of experience seems to be one of the fundamental drives
            in human nature. This need for meaning is irrepressible and ongoing.
            Its ranges from the earliest beginnings of rudimentary distinctions
            that the baby starts to make even in utero up to the most elaborate
            explanations of consciousness development into the transpersonal
            realm. Story telling about who we are, and how we see reality is not
            just an individual aspect of meaning making, it is also a shared
            activity of groups.

          <h3>Ego as representation</h3>

          <p>
            When we speak of ego as representation we refer to as
            &ldquo;I&rdquo; and what I consider to be me or myself . It includes
            one&rsquo;s self-identity and self-definition. Ego development
            theory thus is a story about how one&rsquo;s self-identity can
            radically change over the course of development. It is a theory of
            identity formation.
          </p>

          <h3>Lines of development and the ego</h3>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory is consciously looking at the whole person
            and does so in a comprehensive way. There are many more
            developmental theories that measure cognitive complexity alone or
            focus on other specific lines or domains of human development than
            theories that deal with meaning making and the whole person. While
            important in understanding differences among people, the different
            lines do not explain why human beings tell stories about themselves
            in the first place whatever the line. Lines do not illuminate what
            each stage looks and feels like as an integrated structural whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though Kegan&rsquo;s The evolving self (1982) is closest in
            intention to Ego Development Theory, it is based on Piagetian
            notions and addresses primarily the growth of the mind. It focuses
            on the move from subject to object as the central mechanism for
            growth. It does propose a logical sequence of invariant stages
            through which adults develop. Nonetheless, Subject-Object theory
            does not identify as central the unifying drive to make sense of
            experience by constructing a coherent story about it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not surprisingly, most research in the field of constructive
            developmental theory focuses on cognitive aspects of development and
            the complexity of reasoning about whatever the test makers present
            as stimuli and tasks. Cognitive theoreticians can rightfully claim
            that their measures are more robust in their narrowly defined
            domains than measures that try to assess broader areas of human
            being. This is so because, the narrower the focus in general, the
            easier it is to create tasks to measure the target features in
            question and the more robust the resulting statistics.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the following must be raised as a concern: It seems that
            most of the cognitive developmental theoreticians and
            psychometricians pay no or very little attention to the constructed
            and &ldquo;abstracted&rdquo; nature of their measurements. With the
            exception of Wilber (1985), they are not focusing on the underlying
            linguistic assumptions no matter how complex and formidable their
            frameworks. The less grounded and the more abstract (&ldquo;pulled
            away&rdquo; from experience) the algorithms for measuring something
            are, the further away are the resulting metrics from the actual
            underlying lived experience. These authors tend to bemoan an
            instrument like the MAP as fuzzy or even pronounce that meaning
            making is not measurable. Einstein supposedly had a sing hang in his
            Princeton office that read: &quot;Not everything that counts can be
            counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, there is the problem that knowing about something has
            little relationship to being able to integrate that understanding
            into one&rsquo;s living and being. A trend we call
            &ldquo;aboutism.&rdquo;26 One can learn to reason more complexly
            about a moral dilemma, for instance, or pass a test on
            Wilber&rsquo;s AQAL theory. Yet such knowledge can remain espoused
            theory rather than theory-in-action as defined by Chris Argyris and
            David Schoen (1977). According to these authors, people are guided
            in their actions by mental models about the world, that is by tacit,
            unexamined maps or a set of unconsciously held beliefs, assumptions
            and rules. These are rarely congruent with the explanations that
            people give to themselves and others to make sense of why they do
            what they do.
          </p>

          <p>
            What does Ego Development Theory offer as an explanation of the
            human condition?
          </p>

          <p>
            Metaphorically speaking, Ego Development Theory provides us with one
            possible account of how individuals navigate the straits of human
            existence by using navigational lore, common sense, increasingly
            complex maps, algorithms, and intuition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego Development Theory describes a psycho-logical (sic) system with
            three major interrelated components or dimensions of meaning making.
            It tries to give answers to a set of essential questions that
            describe the experience of being a human being as shown in Table xxx
            below.
          </p>

          <img src="table 2.png" alt="" />

          <p>
            Table 2. Questions about thinking, being, and doing at each stage
          </p>

          <p>
            The operative component looks at what adults see as the purpose of
            life, what needs they act upon, and what ends they are moving
            towards. The affective component deals with emotions and the
            experience of being in this world. The cognitive component addresses
            the question of how a person thinks and reasons about him or herself
            and the world. It is important to understand that each stage or
            emerges from a synthesis of doing, being, and thinking.27 While
            cognitive capacity seems to be a prerequisite for continued growth,
            it is not sufficient for gaining ego maturity. Many very smart
            people who score high on intelligence tests, score at the
            conventional levels of ego development precisely because maturity
            and wisdom are not the same as complex reasoning applied to solving
            specific cognitive tasks.
          </p>

          <p>
            The major difference of Ego Development Theory from other
            constructivist developmental theories consists in the broad
            understanding of ego as the story teller and integrator of all
            aspects of a person&rsquo;s awareness. Howard Gardner (1985) first
            introduced the notion of multiple intelligences or separate lines of
            development. There are numerous specific tests that measure various
            lines. They are also given much attention in Wilber&rsquo;s AQAL
            theory. Ego or what Wilber used to call the &ldquo;self
            system&rdquo; integrates them all into an overall worldview or take
            on reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Human beings are whole persons. They make sense in a comprehensive
            way, always aiming to be able to explain their overall experience by
            creating a coherent narrative. The existentialists were perhaps
            closer to understanding the need for meaning than many people
            working in the adult development field today.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, we can also focus on what innate proclivities,
            favorable circumstances and external supports enhance the capacity
            of individuals to synthesize a self-supporting story from the
            myriad, constantly changing challenges and demands of life and to
            live a life full of vigor and forward motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            They realized that small disturbances can be dealt with our defenses
            whereas anxiety is the results of a deeper malaise. It&rsquo;s the
            absence of meaning resulting from a profound incapacity to make
            sense of life over a prolonged period of time.
          </p>

          <h3>The basic human drive for differentiation and integration</h3>

          <p>
            Human development in general can be looked at as a progression of
            different ways of making sense of reality or in a sequence of stages
            of meaning making. The stages follow each other alternating between
            those that emphasize, on balance, differentiation over integration
            and those favoring integration over differentiation. It&rsquo;s a
            matter of relative preference, however, not of an either/or
            situation. In Ego Development we observer this pattern of ongoing
            differentiation and integration both overall and from stage to
            stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the mid-sixties psychologists first postulated that human beings
            individuate by continuously renegotiating the balance between
            differentiation and integration. Angyal called it the innate double
            trend towards autonomy and homonomy. He defines homonomy in this
            way: &ldquo;Homonomy is the wish to be in harmony; with a unit one
            regards as extending beyond the individual self. The &#8230; whole
            may be represented &#8230;.by a social unit&mdash;family, clan,
            nation&mdash;by an ideology, or &#8230; by a meaningfully ordered
            universe&rdquo; (1965, p. 15). We know this polarity also by other
            names, such as separation and participation; mastery and
            relatedness; independence and connection; or agency and communion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The image of a spiral below represent the
            differentiation-integration trend in development especially well.
            Overall, we account for this pattern as follows. Stages 3, 4, 5, and
            6 , that is the single number stages on the left side of the diagram
            represent stages of integration. People at these levels are embedded
            in a specific holding environment. They move from identifying with
            others who are externally alike to oneself at Stage 3, to the
            like-minded at Stage 4, to the like-principled at Stage 5, and to
            the like-spirited at the Unitive Stage 6---where spirit is seen as
            radiant in all sentient beings. People at these more communal or
            collective stages are generally more at ease because they feel
            connected in ways that fits their current cognitive, emotional and
            transactional needs. This is in contrast to the uneven numbered
            stages of differentiation. Because of the nature of separating
            oneself from a previous embeddedness, there is more discomfort and
            more uncertainty.
          </p>

          <img src="alternating.png" alt="" />

          <p>Figure. Alternating Stages Of Differentiation And Integration</p>

          <p>
            Stages 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, and 5/6 Stages called or Self-protective,
            Self-conscious, Individualist / Pluralist, and Construct-aware
            respectively are stages of differentiation. Individuals at these
            stages can step back and distance themselves from the previous known
            holding environment. They take on a new and greater perspective.
            They tend to assert their newly won independence and often reject
            prior ideas of what constitutes the good life. At the same time they
            generally express some distress because of the loss of the
            connection and certainty they leave behind.
          </p>

          <p>
            The same spiral figure also depict the move from conventional to
            postconventional meaning making as an overall shift from increasing
            differentiation to a greater and greater integration of personality
            and meaning making. Unlike Integral Theory , we find that this
            transition is as or more fundamental than the transition between
            first tier and what AQAL refers to as second tier.
          </p>

          <p>
            An overall shift from differentiation to integration also marks the
            transition from conventional to postconventional stages. The first
            two tiers of development constitute a movement away from the
            symbiotic embeddedness of the newborn towards greater and greater
            separation and independence. Said differently, development from
            birth to adulthood shows an overall trend of increasing
            differentiation towards an independent, well-defined, individual
            self-identity or self-authorship.
          </p>

          <img src="arc.png" alt="" />

          <p>Figure 3: The Arc Human Development (current stage names)</p>

          <p>
            This movement is equally evident in communal cultures. Piaget first
            postulated that formal operations -- the Achiever stage in this
            model -- is the adult stage per se as it allows for differentiated,
            analytic functioning and reasoning within the parameters given by a
            specific society or culture. From the conventional Western
            perspective, the acquisition of this scientific, rational frame of
            mind is seen as the goal of socialization and schooling and defines
            what it means to be seen as a fully grown adult. The
            postconventional stages (from the Individualist Stage 4/5 through
            the Unitive Stage 6) show an overall trend of assimilation and
            integration towards an ever more conscious sense of unity with the
            ground.
          </p>

          <p>
            By most modern expectations, fully functional adults see and treat
            reality as something preexistent and external to themselves made up
            of permanent, well-defined objects that can be analyzed,
            investigated, and controlled for our benefit. This view is based on
            a maximal separation between subject and object, thinker and
            thought. It epitomizes the traditional scientific frame of mind that
            is concerned with measurement, prediction, and control. It also
            represents the goal of much of Western socialization and schooling.
            Most adults (including many developmentalists are not concerned with
            the basic arbitrariness of defining the objects. They are quite
            unaware that according to Koplowitz &quot;the process of naming or
            measuring pulls that which is named out of reality, which itself is
            not nameable or measurable.&rdquo;28 They assume that subject and
            object are distinct, and that by analyzing the parts one can figure
            out the whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            In much of the research literature using Loevinger&rsquo;s ego
            development framework &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; ego development refers
            to the self-authoring Achiever stage since today&rsquo;s modal stage
            is somewhere between Expert and Achiever. (See Manners and Durkin,
            2004). Thus helping individuals who make meaning from the Diplomat
            and Expert stages to move to the self-regulating Achiever stage is
            seen as a central task of society and its institutions.

            Later (higher) is not necessarily better than earlier meaning
            making, it&rsquo;s a matter of optimal fit
          </h3>

          <p>
            Unlike other theories which propose and describe later stages as
            ever more ideal and better ways of being, EGO DEVELOPMENT THEORY
            shows how each new stage has its own strength and deeper insights as
            well as its stage-specific vulnerabilities and new forms of
            unhealthy expression. As Loevinger noted a long time ago, later is
            not happier or more adapted. On the contrary, with greater awareness
            comes also greater awareness of unresolvable dilemmas and paradoxes
            in life. As emphasized before, from a Construct-aware perspective,
            it is useful to give multiple representations of the same territory
            of experience as various representations point out different areas
            of focus and their dynamic interrelationships.

            Mapping the Expansion of Self-Awareness: From Birth to

          </h3>

          <p>
            None of the other developmental theories seems to pay quite the same
            attention to the phenome- non of the evolution of perspective taking
            even though the capacity to take multiple perspectives is mentioned
            in almost all theories as a mark of more advanced development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will use this structural indicator as one of the most salient
            markers by which to gage a person&rsquo;s level of consciousness.
            Knowing what order of perspective a person can take, helps to
            anticipate what a they can see and process regarding both their
            internal and external reality. The above figurative representation
            of the ongoing &ldquo;ramification&rdquo; and increasing capacity
            for perspective taking is fleshed out in more detail in the
            following separate stage descriptions. These answer the questions in
            Table 2 as to what is likely to be observed at each stage in terms
            of complexity of action, affect and thought. We intend to show that
            each level relates differently to these various aspects of reality.
            Indeed, one can say that each stage constitutes its own reality.
          </p>

          <p>Specifically, I will address the following:</p>

          <p>
            A summary description of the nature of each tier: preconventional,
            conventional, and postconventional.

          <p>
            - A figurative representation of each separate level of perspective
            taking in sequential order - Chief new capacities and differences to
            the prior stage - A description of the present type of self-identity
            - Cognitive capacity - Level of internal awareness and emotions -
            Relational capacity - Main concerns and available coping strategies
            - Some language clues
          </p>

          <h3>Bell-like distribution of stage</h3>

          <p>
            To begin with, it is useful to understand that the distribution of
            Stages has a bell-curve like shape. Early and late stages occur much
            more rarely in adults than the conventional and early
            postconventional ones. The samples below represent different
            selection criteria. The newer samples come from more professional
            groups or from individuals who selected to take the MAP instrument
            on their own accord. The inclination to find out about one&rsquo;s
            own personality make-up via testing rarely occurs before the
            Achiever stage. When MBA students at Boston College -- who had taken
            a sentence completion test in the admission process -- were given an
            opportunity to request feedback on their results free of charge,
            Diplomats and Experts chose not to engage.
          </p>

          <p>
            When claims are being made that we are on a tipping point in
            humanity&rsquo;s overall consciousness evolution, we have to be
            cautious about what sample of people we look at. The table 3 shows
            the distribution of stages in 4 different populations based on
            different selection criteria. The often cited 10% for this shift is
            not a robust estimate based on any actual data. It&rsquo;s more of a
            hunch &ndash; and a hope.

            Most publications use my dissertation numbers (N=4510) too give a
            sense of the overall distribution of stages. It is the most diverse
            sample available so far. It includes priests and prisoners,
            accountants and artists, and subjects spanning ages 18-82 with the
            middle 35-65 being the most represented.

            What follows is a description of how each stage is a whole
            structural unity in itself as well as a part of a larger, more
            complex and integrated way of looking and acting in the world. Each
            stage has its own stage-specific achievements and triumphs over
            earlier stages as well as its specific limitations and
            vulnerabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The earliest tier, the preconventional, is rarely encountered in
            professional contexts as we expect these to be traversed in
            childhood and left behind as main modes of functioning. However,
            they reside as experiences in our memories and serve as fallback
            positions in times of extreme duress. At later stages, we also have
            access to them in more skillful ways in order to maximize the
            support and influence we have on those at earlier levels who may
            need clear boundaries and &ldquo;behavior manage- ment&rdquo; to
            function in society. It is seen as a sign of later stage capacity if
            one has access to prior stages and can choose to employ their
            strengths depending on the context and the need of the situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall we will give a general description of each stage which
            addresses cognitive, behavioral and affective aspects of a person at
            the given level. A diagram represents the current level of
            perspective taking and summarizes chief aspects of that
            level&rsquo;s meaning making.

          <h3>THE PRECONVENTIONAL STAGES</h3>

          <p>
            Because it is a theory of adult development, Ego Development Theory
            does not focus on infant and child development about which there is
            ample literature on both the micro and macro level and in all areas
            of interest. I mention these vital aspects here briefly for
            completeness. There is wide consensus that human beings are born
            undifferentiated and symbiotically merged with their initial
            caregivers. Good adjustment in adulthood depends on the successful
            solution to the problems of these earliest periods in life including
            developing a separate self-identity as well as adequate
            psychosexual, intellectual, emotional, social and moral development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Infants also have not yet acquired verbal language. All development
            from birth to the beginning capacity for language is subsumed in the
            Symbiotic Stage 1 in Loevinger&rsquo;s theory.
          </p>

          <p>
            We follow her tradition and just mention Stage 1 briefly. The
            Impulsive to Self-protective adult stages are next. These represent
            a child&rsquo;s normal maturation from age 2 to about age 12 as well
            as stages of &ldquo;arrested&rdquo; development in adults. We
            introduce Stage 2 as representative of adults who have already
            achieved a vital move out of the very earliest totally dependent
            infant days. They are beginning to use simple verbal language. They
            can express their most basic needs-with crying, making noises,
            pointing to themselves and to things they want or recognize. When
            things don&rsquo;t go their way, they often have temper tantrums or
            hide. There is as yet little impulse control. Adults at the
            Impulsive Stage 2 can generally only survive under the protection of
            others or in institutions. Mentally delayed and seriously
            emotionally disturbed individuals are among those adults needing
            life-long support and protection.
          </p>

          <p>
            A good percentage of adults in some cultures operate from the
            Opportunist Stage 2/3. Natural disasters, social upheaval and war
            are some of the threat conditions that invite or may even demand
            opportunistic behavior for survival. The &ldquo;Rule-oriented&rdquo;
            stage between Self-protective stage 2/3 and the Conformist stage 3
            is included here for theoretical reasons as well to show the
            step-wise evolution of perspective taking. While common in
            adolescence, it is very rarely seen in adults and not included in
            the stages of the LMF.
          </p>

          <p>
            To figuratively represent the increasing perspective, I will use the
            following symbols:
          </p>

          <p>The Symbiotic Stage 1:</p>

          <p>Cognitive: 1a nominal actions30 Perspective on the self: none</p>

          <p>Self: Con-fused, confounded, undifferentiated self</p>

          <p>
            Others: not distinct and separate, but simply sources of survival
          </p>

          <p>
            It is at this stage that infants first begin to construct a stable
            world of objects for themselves. In doing so, they separate
            themselves out as objects in the world as well. They can now refer
            to themselves as &ldquo;Bobby wants&rdquo; or &ldquo;me&rdquo;.
            According to the conception of language as a fundamental aspect of
            meaning making, the self sense develops in conjunction with the
            cultural context, the shared language and values as well as the
            outer reality. These are inevitably intertwined31. Development does
            not happen outside of a viable environment. Strands of development
            later quite distinct are very much undifferentiated at this stage
          </p>

          <p>
            The Symbiotic stage is not represented in the Leadership Maturity
            Framework or in the MAP32 or in Loevinger&rsquo;s work as adults at
            this stage are likely pre- or nonverbal and usually
            institutionalized or completely dependent on the care and protection
            of others. They do appear in the work world as clients and patients
            and their care requires great patience, inner strength and
            compassion. If cared for by people at preconventional stages
            themselves such as in prisons, the care givers exploitative and
            abusive tendencies may need monitoring.
          </p>

          <p>The Impulsive Stage 2:</p>

          <p>The first person perspective = 1stpp</p>

          <p>Cognitive: 2a Primary actions, sensorimotor stage</p>

          <p>
            Self: rudimentary, physical self-labeling &ldquo;me, mine&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>Differentiation: in crude dichotomies</p>

          <p>
            Others: needs fulfillment on demand, actions directed towards
            getting although there is little understanding of how to get what
            one needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Children at the Impulsive stage are governed by their impulses;
            hence this is called the impulsive stage. They make sense of the
            world entirely through senses and movement. They don&rsquo;t have
            many ways to deal with setback, yet they may notice and react when
            they don&rsquo;t have enough of what you want, or when things are
            away33. Mom is there holding you and feeding you, and then,
            it&rsquo;s over and she puts you in your crib. At this stage,
            you&rsquo;re totally dependent upon others, and if you&rsquo;re
            reasonably well cared for, you make sense of being alive by feedback
            from your sensations. Magical ideas prevail and a sense of unlimited
            power exists only curbed by punishment from or withdrawal by those
            who have more power than you. Punishment is not related to
            one&rsquo;s behavior but perceived as random or retaliatory and as
            imminent in things. Adults at this level show signs of the beginning
            use of language simultaneously with the emerging ego as reflected in
            such statements as &ldquo;I want.&rdquo; They assert their budding
            sense of self by such words as &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and by expressing
            ownership &ldquo;mine.&rdquo; Like young children, adults at this
            stage are governed by trying to fulfil their basic needs. If these
            are not met, the Stage 2 persons have little recourse other than
            crying, screaming, or withdrawing into themselves. They are easily
            overwhelmed, feel abandoned. The general tenor of this level is a
            profound sense of helplessness.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is the first stage that is measured with the MAP, and reflects
            the first person perspective. This means, people at this level can
            only look in one direction. The inability to grasp fully some of the
            verbal clues in the MAP instrument marks the limited understanding
            of the world characteristic of this stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other people are simply seen as objects who can gratify their needs,
            not as people with their own needs. Good people give to me, mean
            ones don&rsquo;t. There is cognitive simplicity together with verbal
            limitations. The impulsive individual has an inadequate conception
            of the complexities of adult life and of the world and readily
            appears confused, anxious, and overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most cases individuals at this early adult stage need protective
            custody, live at home with their parents or in institutions. They
            need legal guardians as they cannot make decisions for themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Main anxiety: not yet differentiated out. A constant and vague sense
            of threat and insecurity is ever-present.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language Clues: We find very simple statements: things are good or
            bad, clean or dirty; people are nice or mean. Present and past tense
            sentence stems are not distinguished. Subjects are unable to
            understand and respond to the longer stems such as &ldquo;crime and
            delinquency could be halted if &ndash;&ldquo; Affects are expressed
            in bodily terms rather than as feelings. When I get mad, I see red.
            Repetition of a few simple ideas is the most conspicuous sign of the
            Impulsive stage. Many protocols contain the same or almost the same
            one word completions to several stems. A lack of affect and a
            helpless tone is also typical of this level.
          </p>

          <h3>Self-Protective or Opportunistic Stage 2/334</h3>

          <p>First person perspective with an energetic target</p>

          <p>Cognitive: 2b preoperational actions</p>

          <p>
            Self: single concrete features, minimal action-based self-
            description in terms of what I want
          </p>

          <p>
            Other: a beginning sense of others as having their own wants and
            competing for goods, space, dominance, and power
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a stage of differentiation, of emerging out of total
            dependence on the care of others. At the prerational, preoperational
            stage children learn to talk with more than one word sentences and
            begin to use symbols, but they don&rsquo;t yet understand cause and
            effect or the general rules regarding how the world works. For this
            reason, even adults at this stage of development tend to use magical
            thinking to make sense of the world and their place in it. This
            mindset may work adequately especially in certain cultures and
            subcultures (prisons), which is why some people stay at this stage,
            sometimes for life time. In the modern world, most people at this
            stage are disadvantaged and considered &ldquo;uncivilized&rdquo;
            while as developmentalists we would say &ldquo;not yet
            socialized.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            This stage is familiar to most people from watching or dealing with
            young children before they enter kindergarten. For a time,
            everything becomes a test of wills for two-year olds. Tantrums and
            hitting are the result of a thwarted will as well as a reaction to
            conflicting needs and frustrated desires that cannot yet be
            internally negotiated. At this stage, arguments and logic are
            useless. These behaviors are also common in adults at the
            Self-protective stage. They are not capable of insight into
            themselves or others in a psychological sense. But they have a
            greater sense of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, who they can and
            who they cannot manipulate than the earlier, more helpless stages.
            Their actions have not only directionality but a target. They know
            that the only way one can get what one wants is by controlling
            others and protecting oneself.
          </p>

          <p>
            We distinguish between the Opportunist and the Self-protective
            expressions of the same worldview depending on the
            individual&rsquo;s physical power and temperament.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Opportunist version of the Self-protective stage is aware of his
            or her physical strength and size (or status power) and may use it
            to intimidate others in order to get what they want. Opportunists
            are generally wary of others&rsquo; intentions and tend to
            anticipate the worst. Everything to them is a war of wills. Life is
            a zero-sum game. It is important to realize that much aggression may
            stem from profound uncertainty, a sense of vulnerability and being
            confronted by a world whose rules they may not actually understand.
            In a self-protective move, Opportunists may be aggressive to
            pre-empt expected strikes of others. They are people of action, not
            of thought and planning.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, those who are shy and physically less strong and
            able to defend themselves fit the Self-protective form of this
            level. Because of their greater strength and the supremacy of males
            in many cultures, it is more often women who inhabit this world. 35
            They focus on protecting themselves and not becoming a target of
            others&rsquo; aggression. It is ironic that individuals at this
            level are rarely seen. They are invisible because hiding is a common
            and sometimes temporarily successful way of dealing with their
            vulnerability to being bullied, abused and exploited.
          </p>

          <p>
            Self-protective adults of both forms are careful to maintain their
            essentially fragile selves. The self is not yet a separate adult
            self, but one synonymous with one&rsquo;s will, ideas, wishes. The
            self may be felt as having two sides, an inner real self, and an
            outer self or &ldquo;a false face&rdquo; in order to shield oneself.
            This can lead to secrecy, underhandedness and deceit. If others knew
            what I wanted, they would have power over me. Self-protective people
            need to resist the will of others, to test limits and to assert
            their own control be that by acting big or by withdrawing. Because
            there is a beginning ability to anticipate reactions in others, this
            is the first stage with an emerging awareness of others as separate
            people or &ldquo;objects.&rdquo; The Self-protective stage thus
            acquires the rudiments of conscious social interaction. &ldquo;If I
            understand what others are after, I can better work them to get what
            I want.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Feelings. Persons at this level often &ldquo;get into
            trouble.&rdquo; Trouble happens inadvertently when you cross a
            boundary. Self-protective folks try to look out for trouble and to
            avoid its consequences.. For For both Self-protective and
            Opportunistic persons, the world is a hostile place rife with
            danger. Rules are recognized, but mostly followed for immediate
            advantage or to avoid punishment. Being clever and grabbing
            opportunities is necessary for survival. Self-respect is experienced
            in relation to the amount of control one can achieve in opposition
            to others. Self-protective individuals often think they are the odd
            person out. They may feel isolated, but do not know how to relate to
            others differently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always me against the
            rest.&rdquo; This creates a self-perpetuating dynamic of very low
            trust and hyper-vigilance. In a social context, they are often
            invested in concrete visible world of &ldquo;things&rdquo; one owns.
            These are meant to demonstrate one&rsquo;s position of power from
            tattoos, to clothing, to fancy boy toys.
          </p>

          <p>
            Morality: When Opportunists lose a test of will, or overstep a
            boundary, they see the cause as outside themselves. They get
            frustrated and tend to show free-flowing anger and hostility. Others
            are to blame, never oneself. Their own anger towards the world is
            projected outward. Thus others are experienced as angry all the
            time. Self-protective people have an expedient morality. Actions are
            only bad if one is caught and punished. When caught, people at this
            stage are shameless and show little remorse. They do not feel
            responsible for failure or trouble they cause because they do not
            yet understand the connection between action and consequences, that
            is, linear causality. Blaming others for one&rsquo;s shortcomings is
            a way to protect oneself. Stage 2/3 individuals rely on luck tokens
            and magic to protect themselves. Individuals who choose dangerous,
            but dangerous jobs often represent the positive, daring aspects of
            this stage. Some firefighters and test pilots, for instance, are
            known to carry lucky charms, and are often described by others as
            loners. They may also inhabit later stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal: Self-protective individuals especially the
            Opportunist type tend to cause much friction and hurt feelings
            wherever they go because of the &ldquo;I win, you lose&rdquo;
            mentality. This is especially so in relationship to others at more
            conventional stages. In turn, others describe Opportunists as
            unpredictable, unreasonable, manipulative and exploitative. They
            resent the &ldquo;brutish&rdquo; and &ldquo;egocentric&rdquo;
            behavior and may call them names. Nonetheless, it is possible for
            Opportunists to achieve considerable career success. This is
            especially common in contexts where a good nose for business
            opportunities presents an immediate, short-term advantage and where
            unilateral power is given some respect. This form of dealing with
            others is therefore often part of gang culture and prison
            hierarchies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Social: Self-protective people are not well embedded in social
            networks and do not understand subtle human interactions that are
            not based on power differentials. Their relationships with others
            tend to be volatile. Friendships blow up easily. Feelings are
            externalized and projected outward. We see little expression or
            reflection on their own emotions both because of a lack of insight
            as well as for self- protection. Showing weakness of any kind is
            dangerous. &ldquo;The more others know about me, the more they can
            take advantage of me.&rdquo; Thus, most Self-protective individuals
            tend to express general hostility and readiness for fight or flight.
            Those in specific high-risk jobs (test pilots, prison guards,
            firefighters if they make meaning from the Self-protective stage,
            must rely on their buddies to survive and may therefore have mutual
            protection pacts. Cognitively smart individuals at the Opportunistic
            stage, may be able to present a noble mask saying all the right
            things, mentioning pro-social values, but act out as soon as they
            perceive any threat to their wishes and power.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on their own stage of development, Opportunists are often
            charged with immoral and self-serving, manipulate behavior that they
            ought to stop. As developmentalists we counter, that it is not a
            matter of will or wanting, but a lack of understanding that the
            Opportunist displays.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive style: Thinking is concrete and dichotomous, based on
            global, undifferentiated judgments, and simple ideas. Things look
            black or white. Others are either for me or against me.

          <p>
            Preoccupations: Favorite themes are those of domination, gaining
            control and advantage, and deceptive maneuvers. On the other hand,
            Self-protective people are always fearful that someone else is
            trying to dominate, control or deceive them. Internal dimension:
            Self defined as what one does or wants to do right now rather than
            in terms of psychological states or plans and longer-term goals.

            Problem solving &ldquo;This is your problem, not mine.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Defenses: Self-protective adults use blaming and a system of
            distortions to minimize anxiety and maximize good self-feelings.
            Their defenses or coping style is immature: Fantasy, acting out,
            projection are the most common ones. All causality and all-important
            psychological action is seen to be part of the constantly
            threatening outside world. (See Vaillant&rsquo;s hierarchy of
            defense mechanisms).
          </p>

          <p>
            Depression: There must be something wrong if I can&rsquo;t get what
            I want. I hate it when I am feeling controlled and constrained.
            Sadness may be expressed in aggression towards self or others.
          </p>

          <p>Main anxiety: Threat of annihilation or enslavement.</p>

          <p>
            Sample character: &ldquo;Archie Bunker&rdquo;-types. They are
            self-protective, bull-headed and have tunnel vision, constantly
            blowing up and blaming others for what is happening to them. At
            times they have a biting humor that exposes others&rsquo; soft
            sides. Self-protective adults are concerned with their concrete
            little world, often thrilled with bodily aspects and satisfactions.
            They show prejudice; polarize arguments and exploit others&rsquo;
            weaknesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Experience is described in simple dichotomies -
            good/bad, right/wrong, fun/boring or with concrete, physical words
            such as in &ldquo;life is hard.&rdquo; Often strong negative affect
            is expressed. Sentences are short with barely an explanation or
            elaboration. Opportunists may use physical terms for non-physical
            concepts and only differentiate among the simplest feelings such as
            feeling sick, upset, excited, and mad.
          </p>

          <h3>The Rule-oriented stage, Delta/3:</h3>

          <p>
            This stage is subsumed under the Conformist-Diplomat Stage 3 in LMF
          </p>

          <p>The second person perspective</p>

          <p>Cognitive: 3a primary actions</p>

          <p>
            Self: single external features; beginning comparisons, one variable
            at a time
          </p>

          <p>
            Other: I see the other and the other sees me and notices what I look
            like and what I do; beginning recognition that if I want something
            from others I have to make myself appealing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Delta/3 stage is included here because it shows the cognitive
            differentiation that occurs from Self-protective thinking to
            Conformist dependence and provides a logical link for mental growth.
            It is not included in our measurement tool, the MAP, because it is
            statistically rare as mentioned in endnote #7.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this stage people vacillate between two points of view. They can
            take one or the other view, but not both at once. Sometimes they
            wonder &ldquo;how do you look to me?&rdquo; but newly also
            &ldquo;how do I look to you?&rdquo; They now recognize external
            differences regarding self-presentation and behaviors. Often
            children entering school are exploring this developmental stage. The
            Rule-oriented stage describes adults who are discovering the second
            person perspective and who begin to make simple, external
            comparisons based on concrete mental operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            They become preoccupied with finding out the social conventions and
            rules based on the beginning need to fit in and to be liked. One
            wants to look &ldquo;right,&rdquo; and acceptable, therefore the
            emphasis is on external attractiveness and appearance. People at
            this stage show more trust in the world since acceptance and
            protection can be gained by following the rules. The world is
            experienced as less hostile than for Self-protective folks. Persons
            want to be &ldquo;re-spected&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;seen&rdquo;
            by others. Respect can now be gained by adhering to group norms, not
            just by might. One also gives respect to others in the form of
            noticing them and how they act and look. &ldquo;People notice me
            when I am here. I listen to them, they listen to me.&rdquo; With the
            second perspective, one discovers the possibility for simple
            feedback. One can find out what others think about one. &ldquo;I can
            ask my friends what they think; they will tell; and the world
            doesn&rsquo;t collapse! I can trust them.&rdquo; The ability to take
            a second person perspective is a milestone in the development of
            social interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this stage, the superficial likeness to others is discovered and
            experienced as comfort. One is not alone! This new feeling is
            enjoyed in loose associations such as clubs, in which one shares
            similar action interests and hobbies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Rule-oriented subjects make simple factual
            statements, refer to concrete behavior and single features of
            appearance. They are passively responding to stimuli, trying to
            avoid getting in trouble, but uncertain how to do this. They may
            feel they have done something wrong, but they can&rsquo;t say how or
            why. Overall their utterances often lack affect either positive or
            negative.
          </p>

          <p>THE CONVENTIONAL STAGES</p>

          <p>
            The Conformist, Self-conscious and Conscientious stages, stages 3,
            3/4, and 4 respectively, cover the ego stages of most people after
            about the age of 12. We have found that roughly 80% of adults
            populate these three stages with most people in the adult working
            world moving from the Expert to the Achiever stage. In Piagetian
            terms, stage 3 represents functioning at the concrete operational
            level, stage 3/4 uses abstract operations and stage 4 individuals
            rely on formal operations for their meaning making. According to
            Piaget and the cognitive schools of constructive development,
            Conscientious stage 4 people have a linear view of reality: they
            define objects (variables) as being separate and having closed
            boundaries; they see causality as linear and variables are treated
            as independent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The expanded 3rd person perspective with its formal operational
            capacities is widely considered the adult stage in much of Western
            culture; and society and institutions support and reward its
            achievement. It is also the stage that is described as
            &ldquo;high&rdquo; ego development in research projects that use
            Loevinger&rsquo;s theory only (Manners and Durkin, 2004). A
            citizenry capable of rational deliberation and choice based on
            pertinent criteria (not external features, sameness or tradition)
            would seem to be a necessary precondition for democracy to work.
            Only such a perspective and rational assessment of choices can
            safeguard the whole and at the same time allow changes to be
            reflected in the laws.
          </p>

          <p>The Conformist Stage 3 (Diplomat)</p>

          <p>
            This is a stage of integration into a new social container. At the
            Diplomat or Conformist stage, people make sense of the world in a
            new way. They now have developed enough skills to get around in the
            world, accomplish the daily tasks of life and, in general, manage
            ordinary, concrete things and situations. They now actively want to
            play by the rules. Expanded second person perspective (2nd p.p.)
          </p>

          <p>Cognitive: 3b concrete operations</p>

          <p>
            Self: several external features; vital statistics given; rudimentary
            internal states, conflict avoided or suppressed
          </p>

          <p>Two types of other:</p>

          <p>1. own family, tribe, group, nation:</p>

          <p>
            It is the first stage that can be considered as socialized, that is,
            to know about basic interpersonal skills such as sharing, and
            protecting one another. Most importantly, people at this stage see
            others as important people in their own right. They want to be like
            those in their environment whom they admire. We might say that they
            discovered the beginning of the &ldquo;we-space.&rdquo; They sing
            the choir of the crowd, yet without a separate voice. One can now
            trade magical, egocentric thinking for group-centric thinking and
            the security of being a member of the group. Being a part of a group
            gives people a new way to deal with the fact that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
            hard to be an adult and get along.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            The Conformist stage 3 describes persons with a frame of mind
            naturally developed in latency and early adolescence. Their
            self-identity is defined by their relationship to a group. This
            leads to confused boundaries between oneself and the group (whether
            family, sports team, or nation). Being part of this larger entity
            allows one to be protected and share in its power. The price for
            inclusion is an unexamined demand for loyalty and obedience. This
            holds for both leaders and followers at this stage. In cultures,
            where ostracism is a form of severe punishment, being
            &ldquo;shunned&rdquo; is meant as a death sentence. &ldquo;You no
            longer exist for us.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Conformist adults actually relish the dependency that group
            membership bestows. It provides safety in numbers and a new sense of
            power. The self is defined by and generated by the expectations and
            values of those others to whom one &ldquo;belongs.&rdquo;
            Conformists tend to accept norms without inspection or questioning.
            Their cognitive world is divided into simple categories, and types
            of people, mostly based on external distinctions. Having a holiday
            table just like the one seen in a famous &ldquo;best home&rdquo;
            magazine, or owning a car just like one&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s might
            really make a Conformist happy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The boundaries between self and others, however, are confused,
            literally fused and blurred. On the one hand, there is total
            acceptance of the family and in-group (such as peer groups in
            adolescence), on the other hand, we see blind rejection of deviance
            and out-groups. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;them&rdquo; against
            &ldquo;us&rdquo; now instead of the Self-protective person&rsquo;s
            lonely stance of &ldquo;me&rdquo; against &ldquo;them,&rdquo; which
            included everybody else (even family members). For the Conformist,
            you are either ally and friend and approve of us and what we do, or
            you are the enemy. The more status the group has, the more Diplomats
            feel worthy as one of its members. If it took some effort to fulfill
            the required demonstration of obedience and submission, they feel
            honored to be admitted and wearing the insignia that tell others so.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having a shared truth gives people a ready-made way to make sense of
            the world. Sometimes this goes beyond feeling valued as a member of
            the group. Some groups believe that their truth is the only truth.
            This fosters a sense of superiority. Members are told that they are
            the &ldquo;chosen few&rdquo; that shall be saved. All those who do
            not belong are doomed, considered heathen or barbarians, or whatever
            label makes them lesser or non-human. This kind of mindset is
            particularly common in various fundamentalist religious groups. They
            can judge harshly those who do not belong. It is difficult for
            someone whose self- sense is based on belonging to such a group to
            even realize that there may be others of different faiths who
            believe equally fervently that they have the only truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, Stage 3 people try to uphold tradition and to avoid
            rocking the boat. They are accommodating, sometimes overly nice and
            non-confrontational. They don&rsquo;t like to be singled out and get
            feedback. Feedback is experienced as critique and as having done
            something wrong and displeasing. Diplomats expect guidance from
            above or from those who lead them. They are not yet ready to take a
            stand to express themselves. They don&rsquo;t have their own
            opinions to assert although they may be good at expounding the
            values and beliefs of their group. Nor can they take initiative for
            themselves. They might do so for the benefit of their group when
            told to do so by an accepted authority. Uncertainty and conflicting
            feelings cannot yet be registered as they threaten the very being of
            a Conformist. The description of this stage in terms of &ldquo;not
            yet&rdquo; exposes a common Western bias.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stage 3 persons have to keep up with the neighbors. They make sure
            they are seen in the right places (for instance, in church on
            Sunday) and with the right group. They are often eager to contribute
            to the group by volunteering (PTA, church social, men&rsquo;s club)
            and taking on preset roles in their respective clubs. Acquiring
            material assets and status symbols is important as these symbolize
            status and prove one&rsquo;s worth. Moreover, the visible assets are
            important because the provide real personal satisfaction and they
            indicate one&rsquo;s success. Nametags on the door, being listed as
            the employee of the month show that one is noticed. Trying to keep
            up with fashion, neighbors and material gain can, of course, also
            become a burden and a source of unhappiness and stress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Morality: Conformists adhere to a simple rule: &ldquo;everything
            goes into two piles. The good, or correct, and the bad, or
            incorrect.&rdquo; Knowing the distinction makes it easier to make
            sense of the world. Every decision, every idea, every person, every
            action, fits in one pile or the other. There are few, if any, shades
            of gray, no irony, and no intangibles. Actions are carried out with
            conviction. This is how it is done around here. &ldquo;Either you
            are with us and agree or you are against us.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike at the Rule-oriented stage where simple rules are
            inconsistently adhered too, here rules are beginning to be
            internalized and followed without question. Shame is a common
            response to transgressions and for undesired consequences of
            one&rsquo;s actions. Because of their strongly held and unquestioned
            values, Conformists are apt to feel responsible in situations in
            which they are not to blame. Repeatedly saying &ldquo;I am
            sorry&rdquo; is meant to soften any repercussions. One should have
            done the right thing all along.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conformists are identified with and bound to those with the same
            tastes, attributes, beliefs and expectations, and confused or
            threatened by differing demands, perspectives, diversity, and
            complexity. The values of one&rsquo;s own group get introjected as
            strong &ldquo;shoulds,&rdquo; while the values of those who are
            different are denigrated and likely rejected as &ldquo;evil.&rdquo;
            Thus, life is governed by rules of what can be and cannot be done.
            Others with differing views are morally condemned. Sexual and
            aggressive feelings are likely denied or suppressed out of fear of
            rejection and abandonment. For the same reason, commandments from
            various religious are taken in as the Truth and not examined. The
            &ldquo;holy books&rdquo; contain the literal truth. Any questioning
            of their commandments guaranteeing salvation is seen as a form of
            treason or a sign of having fallen from grace.
          </p>

          <p>
            Social: To be liked one has to have an attractive social
            personality. It is important to be nice, pleasant, and
            accommodating. People are judged by the way they dress and talk and
            by the proper manners. Great care is taken on neatness, outward
            appearance, cleanliness of one&rsquo;s domicile or office.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are those whom by temperament, are more contrary. At the
            Diplomat stage, it is possible to find some sense of OK-ness as a
            non-conformist. Rebels, have-nots and other misfits often need, find
            or create their own cliques. One can either be a loner or create or
            join an alternative group and display the markers that identify one
            as a member of that clique. This can happen because the individuals
            don&rsquo;t fit the prevailing norms or do not have the tokens that
            would help them to belong to the high status group.36 Multiple
            cliques, such as fraternities and sororities on campus, often
            attract various kind ofstudents with a conformist mindset . Each has
            its own traditions with different acceptance rituals and admittance
            oaths.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feelings: Blind conformism, fundamentalism and prejudice can be
            expressions of this early conventional frame of mind. Potential
            aggression against self (putting oneself down) and negative affect
            or disappointment are often countered by demonstrations of overly
            positive feelings and enthusiasm.
          </p>

          <p>
            One&rsquo;s negative feelings &ldquo;I hate you&rdquo; are split off
            and projected outside and then experienced as &ldquo;they hate
            me.&rdquo; Anger and other disagreeable feelings are suppressed as
            they threaten the status quo. They rarely reach awareness.
          </p>

          <img src="self conform.png" alt="" />

          <p>
            Conformists&rsquo; main coping moves are projection and
            introjection. They imagine that others think, want, feel what they
            themselves think, want or feel (projection) and then try to fill
            those imagined needs. They also swallow others&rsquo; definitions,
            norms, values and opinions without questioning (introjection). If my
            mother, the church, or the boss says so, it must be true.
          </p>

          <p>
            To summarize, the Conformist- Diplomat does not yet have a self in
            the sense of a separate adult identity. Instead, he or she is
            defined by others. The self-other boundaries are blurry and not
            differentiated. Thus, relationships often have a dependent,
            &ldquo;sticky, I-need-you&rdquo; quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal style: Because Conformists so desperately want to
            belong, they will conform to the rules and norms of whatever desired
            group, gang, political party they belong to. In companies they are
            the ones that smooth discontent or incipient conflict among
            coworkers and make sure that the place has a pleasant atmosphere.
            They value being nice and helpful. They see relationships in terms
            of expected behaviors (loyalty, being friendly) rather than in terms
            of deep feelings and motives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive style: Conformists are interested in the concrete, visible
            aspects of experience and tend to use superlatives and conventional
            clich&eacute;s to describe it. These clich&eacute;s, however, are
            taken seriously and not experienced as clich&eacute;s. References to
            inner feelings are stereotyped and predictable and aligned with
            cultural expectations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscious preoccupation: Conformists put great value on appearance,
            status symbols, material possessions, reputation and prestige. They
            are concerned with social acceptance and attempt to adjust to group
            norms. They deeply care about other&rsquo;s opinions and evaluations
            although they are not likely to ask for feedback. &ldquo;What do
            others think about this or that, or about me?&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal dimension: Conformist individuals worry about what others
            think and feel at any given moment as their sense of self-worth
            depends on others&rsquo; approval. In protocols they express simple
            &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; feeling states: sad, happy, nervous, upset,
            but do not differentiate feelings into subtler graduations. The
            sense of &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo; and &ldquo;oughts&rdquo; and sense of
            shame and embarrassment if those shoulds are not fulfilled can be
            crushing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Main anxiety: not to belong and to be cast out. Most threatening to
            a Conformist is being disapproved by or deserted by significant
            others, rejected by one&rsquo;s group. Their anxiety is thus a fear
            of being non-existing and the loss of a sense of self as a loss of
            &ldquo;me-as-accepted-by-others.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Problem solving: Generally, emerging problems are denied, or
            relabeled and white-washed. &ldquo;Never mind that. If you look at
            the bright side, it&rsquo;s not really so bad.&rdquo; Asking a
            superior for what to do is the most natural way of dealing with
            difficulties. Conflict is not yet registered or if experience, it is
            avoided as too threatening. It can become great challenge to a
            Diplomat if he or she belongs to different groups with conflicting
            value sets. With today&rsquo;s mobility and complex arrangements,
            this is becoming challenge for Diplomats is becoming more common.
          </p>

          <p>
            Organizational type: Conformists seek acceptance and protection by a
            larger entity. They are most apt to be drawn into organizations with
            a clearly defined identity and hierarchical structures. Clear
            instructions, advice and guidance are preferred over freedom to show
            initiative. Thus, command and control enterprises such as the
            military are attractive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coaching-Counseling style: Conformists like to give lots of
            advice&#61672; telling others what to do or not to do. They also
            tend to compare and evaluate others according to their own
            preferences where the way I manage or we do it here is the right way
            while other ways are simply wrong and need to be corrected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sample characters: Edith Bunker in All in the Family takes all kinds
            of abuse by others, particularly her spouse Archie, but she stays
            with him. She is fluttering and fussing around him, always trying to
            be positive, to see the best in everybody and in everything. Edith
            finds pleasure in taking good care of her loved ones. However, the
            character Edith also displays an open-mindedness which is not
            typical of this stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language signs: The language is often impersonal, nice and positive
            and may be full of clich&eacute;s. Short, stereotypical phrases,
            exaggerated positive affect are common on the MAP. Everybody and
            everything is fun, important, wonderful. When describing situations;
            concrete aspects and factual information is given. Conformists
            describe their and others&rsquo; behavior in terms of I
            &ldquo;always&rdquo;, we &ldquo;never.&rdquo; The vocabulary for
            feeling states is simple, undifferentiated.

          <h3>The Self-conscious or Expert Stage 3/4</h3>

          <p>
            This is a stage of differentiation. A conceptual watershed is
            crossed when one can take the third person perspective.
          </p>

          <p>pp. st 3rd 2nd</p>

          <p>
            Third person perspective: Self and others as separate persons with
            unique differences
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognition: 4a abstract operations; beginning ability to take a 3rd
            person perspective or to look at oneself objectively
          </p>

          <p>
            Self: Separate self is differentiated from others; sense of
            specialness. Identity = clusters of external attributes,
            conventional traits, &ldquo;self-conscious&rdquo; in the sense of
            readily feeling uneasy and being judged.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other: others too are seen as separate persons who are different
            from me. Need for constant comparison and measuring. Do I pass
            muster? Do others measure up to my ideas and standards?
          </p>

          <p>
            The Self-conscious stage 3/4 characterizes people who are now able
            to step back and look at themselves as objects from some distance
            for the first time. This allows them to begin to notice patterns and
            to start to reflect upon their own and others&rsquo; behavior. This
            capacity to reflect on oneself , however, is as yet rudimentary as
            most of an Expert&rsquo;s energy is externally focused.
          </p>

          <p>
            This stage has a distinctly different clinical feel than earlier
            stages. Individuals begin to have access to some self-understanding.
            They now want to be different from others, be recognized as special.
            Often the work hard to differentiate themselves from the immediate
            family context and assert and express their newly discovered
            personhood. Experts also make sure that they are seen as different
            from their parents, siblings and from others doing similar things.
            They feel good when they are noticed and get the respect for what
            they know and can do.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third person perspective permits operations with abstract
            objects and concepts. While conformism was widely spread during
            Loevinger&rsquo;s time, we now find few people operating at the
            early conventional, Conformist stage in our subject pools. In the
            sixties, consciousness raising efforts on all fronts have
            contributed to this social shift from Diplomat to Expert as a
            desired and accepted shift in consciousness. Finding your own voice
            and becoming your separate self identity as an adult is the most
            widely supported and rewarded movement especially in the modern West
            with its emphasis on agency and individualism. The transformation
            from being a part of a group identity to finding one&rsquo;s
            separate identity and finding one&rsquo;s voice is in many ways the
            task of healthy adolescent development. However, it often becomes
            first necessary for doing well when one moves away from home and
            familiar environments or when one enters the work force.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the Self-conscious stage 3/4 the focus changes to individual
            differences away from fitting in and being like those in the
            original reference group. People start to express their own
            personhood more often in contrast to others. They now also tend to
            assert their own needs and wants, which were suppressed at stage 3
            for the sake of being accepted. Indeed the previous enmeshed
            self-sense is now experienced as a constraint, as a fake identity.
            Having played along with the prescribed values no longer feels
            genuine. Given this drive towards separation and individuation,
            Experts often leave the beliefs and values of their family of origin
            behind to the chagrin of those abandoned. They experience this move
            away from tradition as a puzzling and hurtful, or worse as a
            betrayal of their most cherished values.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identity: The third person perspective theoretically also allows for
            beginning introspection. Individuals at the Self-conscious stage are
            now interested in discovering the kinds of behaviors that make them
            successful and respected. They start to describe themselves with
            slightly more differentiated attributes (lonely, jealous, curious
            serious), norms (feminine), and conventional virtues (honest,
            patient) than their Diplomat colleagues. That is, they start to
            describe themselves with common traits - generally recognized
            character patterns that people display over time. This new capacity
            to identify some special characteristics of oneself is enabled by a
            budding understanding of one&rsquo;s life in linear time. One can
            see how one behaved in a specific way before and one expects to
            behave in similar ways again. One may even have an inkling of how
            one would like to be and make an effort to change.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experts of first need to be taught to speak in their own voice and
            assert their position as well as to critically analyze matters as
            simply mouthing the opinions of those one respects is more common.
            Learning to notice their own suppressed and unexpressed feelings and
            thoughts is often the task of therapy and coaching for this group.
            Experts are sensitive, that is, self-conscious, when it comes to
            negative and critical feedback. Criticism is experienced as a rebuke
            of the whole person as Experts are identified with what they do best
            and in what they believe. They often display compulsive and perfec-
            tionist tendencies in their efforts to outdo themselves and to be a
            the top. &ldquo;Good enough&rdquo; is not good enough for many an
            Expert. While they feel hurt and threatened by criticism, they are
            swift with directing criticism towards others. It is the
            shortcomings, faults, and inadequacies of others that make life
            difficult in the Expert&rsquo;s eyes. In addition to having special
            expertise and knowledge in an area of interest, blaming and finding
            fault with others is a chief way to establish one&rsquo;s sense of
            superiority and power.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive: Because of the capacity for abstractions, adolescents as
            well as adults at this stage see multiple possibilities and options.
            They can use them with a vengeance -- offering innumerable solutions
            and permutations for every problem. What is missing is the capacity
            to prioritize, to see that not all solutions are of the same
            quality. Experts tend to focus on doing things right or correctly,
            not yet on doing the right things. That is they offer single loop
            solutions, rather than questioning their preferred approach. Indeed,
            their own way of doing something is seen as the only right way.
            Indeed, They are identified with knowing the newest and most cutting
            edge products and procedures in their area of expertise. The focus
            on detail is one of the reasons that Experts who are promoted to
            managers, often fail. They can&rsquo;t see the bigger picture and
            aims of their department or organization and thus can&rsquo;t
            prioritize accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Social: Experts may reject their family of origin or their childhood
            beliefs, yet they still need a reference group that accepts and
            respects them. Only now they want to be accepted by others because
            of how they are different and special. Expertise and knowledge are
            ways to distinguish oneself. Profes- sional peer groups and
            organizations thus supply the need for approval and belonging.
            Degrees, au- thorities, and reference books in the field also
            provide the needed support for defending one&rsquo;s approach.
            However, feeling special can easily lead to feeling superior as one
            wants to stand out from the crowd.
          </p>

          <p>
            The group is needed, but one stands at its periphery threatening to
            leave, without ever quite leaving.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moral: Stage 3/4 persons often feel they have it all &ldquo;figured
            it all out.&rdquo; They know all the answers. They know what to
            believe. They feel righteous and tend to blame others and to put
            them in the wrong
          </p>

          <p>
            They have high moral standards and a strong sense of what should be.
            &ldquo;Shoulds&rdquo; and &ldquo;oughts&rdquo; are part of their way
            of making sense of life and of orienting themselves. The super-ego
            is very strong. Experts may feel disappointed with themselves when
            they don&rsquo;t fulfill what they know they should yet find excuses
            for why they didn&rsquo;t perform according to their own values.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work: Experts are often difficult for others to work with. They want
            to be single contributors and do not easily collaborate. Not only
            are they critical and often self-assured in their knowledge, they
            tend to be argumentative and hurt when they feel they are not
            respected enough for what they do or say. In general, they do not
            hold back their opinions as they do not yet realize that their
            perspective is only one among many possible ones. They know the
            truth, the best approach, the right way of doing something. Experts
            are happy in perfecting their crafts or procedures. Creating
            efficiencies, perfecting processes and steps to run things more
            smoothly, is part of their many gifts.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, the perfectionism can become their challenge. When
            they need to delegate a task they want it to be done their way. When
            it is not, Experts are quick at taking the task back and executing
            it themselves. Thus, they are often overworked and overburdened by
            their workload and level of perfection, be that at work or at home.
            They cannot yet conceive of the possibility that things could be
            done well in more than one way or that others could also do them
            adequately.
          </p>

          <p>
            They tend to evaluate others according to their own capabilities and
            standards. Severe criticism of how another thinks is a common form
            of intellectual aggression at this stage. A sense of superiority is
            not very well hidden and is activated by the smallest inadequacy in
            others. Technocrats, bureaucrats and highly educated specialists,
            such as engineers and scientists in the hard sciences, are
            particularly prone to get their self-sense from identifying with
            their knowledge or expertise.
          </p>

          <p>
            In interpersonal situations and at work the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo;
            syndrome is very common. Having the last word or one-upmanship -
            that is, listening to the other and then adding one&rsquo;s own
            opinion to remain on top - is typical.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because their process is additive, people at this stage cannot yet
            prioritize among options or synthesize several possibilities. While
            Conformists try to suppress aggression for the sake of acceptance,
            it now reemerges. Self-conscious individuals often have a hostile
            sense of humor. Ridiculing others is a common sport. While there is
            a cognitive capacity to look inside, one&rsquo;s defense is to be
            ultrarational. Rather than being followers or bystanders - the
            preferred roles of the Conformist - Self-conscious persons may
            relish being movers, and initiators. They enjoy oppositional battles
            with others who defend different positions. They live in a world
            where things are sure and clear, and they feel very much entitled to
            impose their views on others. Thus they can seem argumentative and
            opinionated.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the plus side, Experts are concerned with fulfilling their adult
            responsibilities and duties and with doing things right. They are
            very adept at finding new and different solutions, better ideas,
            more perfect procedures, and greater efficiencies and doing things
            well. If managed skillfully, their positive contributions can be
            considerable. Experts are absolutely necessary for running the
            routine affairs of every society and every group. They may prosper
            especially well in today&rsquo;s highly technological and
            digitally-coded world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Impulse control: Self-conscious persons have societal shoulds and
            oughts well internalized. Their super-egos are strong and not
            available for inspection. Feelings of shame and guilt for
            transgressions are expressed in simple terms or rationalized away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive style: Self-conscious persons are capable of abstract
            thought and operations, including multiple views, permutations, and
            careful comparison among variables.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal dimension: &ldquo;Psychology&rdquo; is understood in terms
            of stable moods and traits of self and others. Self-conscious
            persons tend to generate innumerable solutions without being able to
            prioritize among them. The decision process gets often hung up. See
            Perry (1968) on multiplicity. The necessary synthesis and analytical
            weighing of different solutions develops at the next stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Organizational type: Engineering types, technocrats, bureaucrats,
            and a percentage of professionals of every ilk are at home here.
            Being in charge of oneself and one&rsquo;s environment is a chief
            trait. Self-conscious individuals have a clear-minded, pragmatic
            leadership style because they are unencumbered by fundamental
            questions and complexities. &ldquo;Do what I do and you will be
            fine.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief defenses: Self-conscious people intellectualize, rationalize
            and explain away what doesn&rsquo;t fit their expectations or set
            beliefs. They are rarely lost for an answer or an explanation. They
            often blame the structure, the tools, or the incompetence of others
            for what is not working as it should.
          </p>

          <p>
            Counseling/coaching style: As managers and consultants, they are
            asking many questions and accumulate facts. They want to know the
            causes and ask &ldquo;why did you ? This can readily be heard by
            employees or clients as criticism and blaming. They proffer advice
            and share their opinions and interpretations without a sense that
            they are theirs and not necessarily the clients&rsquo;. &ldquo;If I
            can do it, you can&rdquo; is a common message that shows the lack of
            awareness that people differ and that their way may not work for
            everyone. Compared to later stages, Expert coaching clients often
            seem more set in their ways and resistant to change. No one can tell
            an Expert anything they don&rsquo;t know already or know better.
            They will discredit material or arguments that do not fit into their
            own schemes of how life works by dismissing counter-evidence or
            belittling others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Main anxiety: Having just recently discovered their own separate
            personhood, Experts fear losing this sense of specialness. Moreover,
            they fear being reabsorbed and getting drawn back into the fold,
            into the mass of others. They also fear that if they should open
            themselves to others&rsquo; views, they might lose their current
            certainty and strong sense of self. This fear of incompleteness and
            vulnerability is often counteracted by showing a strong front and by
            not admitting any ignorance or vulnerabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Experts are beginning to use more complex syntax.
            The vocabulary for psychological states is becoming more nuanced.
            Simple comparisons are common &ldquo;too much, not enough, similar
            to.&rdquo; We find the rudiments of qualifications, conditions and
            explanations. There is a beginning, yet passive interest in
            causality &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; Notably, there are now
            references to the passing of time &ldquo;sometimes, often&rdquo; and
            occasional brief explanation for their views although simply
            asserting how things are is the favorite mode of expression. Experts
            also now tend to consistently respond with the past tense to past
            tense sentence beginnings.

          <h3>The Conscientious or Achiever Stage 4</h3>

          <p>
            The Conscientious stage is a stage of integration and re-embedding
            oneself in a larger cultural context, but now on ideological
            affinities and self-chosen criteria. It is the target stage for much
            of Western culture. Our educational systems are geared towards
            producing adults with the mental capacity and emotional
            self-reliance of the Achiever stage, that is, rationally competent
            and independent adults. Democracy as a form of government is based
            on the idea of a citizenry that has the capacity to think
            independently and to make reasoned and informed choices . Bob Kegan
            coined the felicitous term &ldquo;self- authoring&rdquo; for this
            level. Along with expertise, an independent, entrepreneurial, and
            self-reliant mindset is the financially most well rewarded stage in
            the US and much of the West.

            Truth: Can be found through appropriate scientific methods if not
            now &#61672; later
          </p>

          <p>
            Our institutions of education, jurisprudence and much of business
            are based on the premise of independent adults pursuing their
            self-chosen interests within the given contours of the social
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The critical new dimension of the Achiever perspective involves a
            full awareness of linear time along with the need for broader
            relational social context. The third person perspective allows
            individuals to look backwards and forwards in life. Conscientious
            folks deliberately want to find out who they are and what they would
            like to become by consciously exploring past experiences and choices
            and thinking about the ideal future self. Five to ten years
            backwards and forwards is now a regularly envisioned timeframe. What
            do you see yourself having accomplished in five years? is also the
            most common prompt in conventional job interviews.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, this is the first stage where people grasp that they can
            continue to grow in mind and heart as adults. They have places to
            go, personal goals to reach, and opportunities for self-knowledge
            and self-improvements. Conscientious folks, cherish self-knowledge
            and work at increasing it. They generally have positive self-regard
            based on their capacities and successes. They have gained a measure
            of independence and self-authorship that makes them feel they are
            the masters of their ships. As captains of their own self-enterprise
            they are no longer as vulnerable to being accepted or excluded as
            Conformists and Self-conscious adults are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive style: Conscientious persons can think in terms of formal
            operations, logic and sequential order. They are beginning to
            appreciate conceptual complexity as well as the nature of a closed
            system. They are aware of contingencies and qualifications, and see
            alternatives to conventional responses to problem solving. They can
            now notice contradictions and inconsistencies both within themselves
            and in the belief systems they adhere to. They may see that the way
            a problem is framed is the problem. They consider that not all goals
            are equally worthy of pursuing, that is, they may begin to recognize
            the potential for double loop exploration. Overall, Achievers are
            planful about their actions, concerned about priorities and
            consequence, and capable of revision and iterative assessment on as
            well as reorienting towards new goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscientious adults generally believe in the perfectibility of
            humankind and in the scientific method to &ldquo;uncover&rdquo; the
            laws of the universe. People believe that the proper scientific
            methods of investigation and procedures will eventually lead to the
            discovery of how things really are. They look for the laws that
            explain human behavior as well as answers to how the universe works.
            Formal operations and abstract rationality are at their peak at this
            level. Much of the world&rsquo;s scientific progress is generated
            from this mindset and with the drive for discovery that is
            quintessential for Achievers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In many contexts, the Achiever mind set and capacities are not fully
            appreciated for what they offer, and for what they continue to
            contribute to human well-being and prosperity. Conscientious adults
            are committed to work towards the betterment of humanity according
            to what they consider an ideal future. Whether they believe in
            democracy, communism, socialism or whatever form of government
            ideology, they are convinced their particular approach is best for
            all.
          </p>

          <p>
            As scientists they have more tolerance than Experts for some delay
            between action and results, research and findings, questions and
            answers and are less likely to believe that they can go it alone.
            Cross-department or cross-disciplinary collaboration is necessary to
            untangle and solve some of the more complex puzzles of the external
            world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Formal operational cognition allows individuals to separate events
            into variables that can be sorted around many criteria. Achievers
            and beyond recognize that making new distinctions is an aspect of
            expanding one&rsquo;s mind and internalizing new knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Making new distinctions is also a bedrock of EGO DEVELOPMENT THEORY
            as it uses distinctions in language to trace the development of
            individual minds and to differentiate among different mind sets and
            self-identifications shared by many people. It is these changing
            ways of shared worldviews that we identify as consecutive stages. As
            a psychometrician, Loevinger and her approach to theory making and
            testing shows the formal operational tenets at their best. She made
            a pioneering and lasting contribution to psychology. At the same
            time, keeping sharp boundaries also limited the reach and usefulness
            of her method. Proof was paramount to her and keeping the SCT-test
            for research only as she created it. Using it in other contexts, for
            example for coaching and supporting clients in vertical development
            was anathema to her., She also objected to using the SCT to explore
            rare hypothesized high-end levels of meaning making because it went
            against her belief in what science is and should do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aboutism: Because of their access to formal operational thinking,
            Achievers can create complex theories as well as learn all about
            complex topics. However this is done from an external point of view:
            They can learn to know everything there is to know about a theory
            without transfer of the conceptions to their interior life. Thus,
            one can pass a test in integral theory, for instance, and yet hold
            the theory as an Achiever. In ED Theory we call this external
            knowing about complex theories &ldquo;aboutism.&rdquo; High
            intelligence and access to cognitive complex thought can seduce
            individuals to overestimate their ego- development. Accordingly,
            cognitively-oriented developmental theories and measurements also
            tend to privilege sheer intellectual prowess, memory, and the
            complexity of arguments over a more holistic, integrated view of
            personality. ED Theory offers a view of development that includes an
            assessment of how individuals hold the knowledge they have and how
            they relate to their knowing. It offers a path that not only values
            intelligence, but a way of looking at human growth that values
            self-awareness, compassion and wisdom.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identity: Persons at the Achiever stage are curious what makes
            themselves and others &ldquo;tick&rdquo; in more than a passive
            &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;-way. They will actively ask to find out
            what motivates others and explore causes of both their own and
            others&rsquo; behavior. While Experts are proud of themselves and
            their cleverness in their area of expertise, Achiever are more aware
            of their overall career path and how they got to where they are. At
            the same time, they trust in the potential to improve themselves
            through effort, learning and feedback. Feedback can now be listened
            to without necessarily agreeing with it or feeling one&rsquo;s whole
            identity has been diminished. Whether the critic is right,
            misinformed, or misjudged me, the their response is useful
            information both about myself and about the critic.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, Achievers are concerned with reasons, causes, goals,
            consequences and the effective use of time. They believe that the
            truth about themselves can be found and are motivated to figure
            things out and to inquire. Personality tests, asking others for
            feedback, Taking educational and professional courses and retreats
            as well as a new level of introspection lead to increasing self-
            knowledge. Achievers learn to understand themselves backwards and
            forwards in time, and describe past feelings, personal dreams and
            future goals. While the past is seen as an important source of
            information and experience, Conscientious folks tend to focus on the
            future and what is yet to be accomplished. With awareness of time as
            a linear progression, there is also a greater capacity to observe
            one&rsquo;s motivations across different periods and in different
            actions. &ldquo;Why do I do what I do?&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, the analysis of others and self-analysis become a favorite
            pastime and challenge. Many typologies and theories about human
            behavior come out of this motivation to classify and understand
            other human beings. From psychoanalysis, to behaviorism, to Rogerian
            therapy, to Gestalt approaches, many of the major therapeutic
            schools were born out of the Achiever mindset. Knowing the root
            causes and reasons for unwanted behavior helps one to fix problems
            and to achieve better outcomes. Indeed, finding the causes and
            working out explanations for what one observes are paramount for the
            scientific, modern method of inquiry and knowledge acquisition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emotional: It is at this level also that individuals become able to
            distinguish in much more subtle ways among different aspects of
            being a human being. They realize that we can deliberately dissemble
            and that it is important to distinguish between appearance and
            feelings, what is being said and what is left unsaid. Formal
            operational cognitive capacity is behind this capacity as it allows
            for variables to be separated and sorted around many criteria. A
            sense self-certainty common at this level comes from the notion that
            one can improve oneself. Because people can and want to explore
            feelings that don&rsquo;t yet fit their current understanding of
            themselves, they are more likely to explore these rather than to
            deny, or ignore them, or project them onto others. They may still
            employ these defenses, but more areas of experience are open to
            inspection. Many become familiar with their own preferred
            proclivities and defenses. Because of their understanding of linear
            time and knowledge acquisition, and because of their ability to
            prioritize, Achievers can now postpone exploration and put things on
            the back burner. If they do notice discrepancies between their
            values and behavior, they can learn to deal with tensions in more
            productive ways than before. Some mention that they consciously use
            negative energy for a positive push. For instance, anger at
            injustices in the child welfare system can be used to make a
            difference by organizing a letter campaign, writing to a congress
            person, or joining or forming an advocacy group.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast, when life doesn&rsquo;t go so well -- when there are
            disappointing results or even &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to achieve goals
            make a difference or to -- Conscientious meaning makers can be very
            severe critics of themselves and fall into deep despair. As
            self-authoring individuals who accepted that they are in charge of
            their own destinies, not being successful is taken as a sign one has
            not done one&rsquo;s best or betrayed one deepest potential. That
            is, one has not just failed the particular cause, but one&rsquo;s
            duty to oneself as a full member of adult society. This exaggerated
            sense of being responsible for how things turn out may lead to
            feelings of guilt and inadequacy. This is so even when external
            circumstances contributed to the unsuccessful outcome. What is not
            yet visible to Achievers is a more systemic view of reality. They
            see themselves as independent wholes rather than also interdependent
            parts of multiple, overarching systems. Additionally, seeing
            positive results and get rewarded for them is an important way the
            Achiever finds self-affirmation. The long-term view, the idea of
            having sown a seed which may or may not take root is not yet enough
            as an Achiever&rsquo;s timeframe is often at best a decade or two.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moral: Conscientious adults have internalized societal standards.
            They often question the &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo; from their family of
            origins and their professional contexts and want to live according
            to their own ideas and self-chosen values. It is with the
            Conscientious stage that people have enough of a perspective on
            themselves as objects and on their life as changing over time to
            become truly introspective. &ldquo;Do I live up to what I believe
            in?&rdquo; is a serious life inquiry. Guilt for having made the
            wrong choices and regret for having missed opportunities are central
            emotions. When aggression is turned inside, self-criticism can be
            severe. Conscientious individuals can fall prey to hypercritical,
            neurotic self-criticism especially easily because their plans and
            intentions are so single-minded and high-aiming. At the same time,
            Conscientious meaning makers may have very high standards for others
            as well and expect them to be self-authoring and responsible like
            themselves. They cannot yet truly fathom that there are people with
            earlier, more limited perspectives, and less choice and capacity
            that they have. They don&rsquo;t understand that an Opportunist will
            likely exploit the system if given half a chance not because he
            doesn&rsquo;t want to but he cannot do other. They do not see that
            Diplomats will not likely thrive when given an opportunity to take
            initiative and to stand out via an individual contribution. They may
            get very frustrated with the single-minded drive of the Expert to
            perfect a narrow specialty without consideration of the bigger
            picture or the overall mandate of an organization. While excellent
            individual contributors, Experts often are unskilled in
            collaboration and cross-disciplinary efforts. Like their
            conventional brethren from earlier stages, Achievers too believe
            that if others were more like them, the world would be a better
            place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal: Because of the genuine interest into who others are
            and the concomitant need to share one&rsquo;s experience,
            interpersonal relationships become intense and important. Social
            contacts become increasingly diverse and rich. Others are
            appreciated for having different expertise as long as they
            don&rsquo;t encroach upon my beliefs. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave our
            personal views aside&rdquo; is a typical Conscientious- type
            compromise that keeps the definite boundaries between parties
            intact, but allows for collaboration. Increased self-differentiation
            and personal independence does not, however, involve more
            egotistical and self-centered behavior. On the contrary, others can
            now be valued for who they are independently of one&rsquo;s own
            needs and wishes. One joins a group or cause as a contract in order
            to accomplish certain goals, to fulfill agreements, and to actively
            partake in the well-ness and governing of the overall enterprise.
            One&rsquo;s loyalty is to a chosen belief system or ideology rather
            than to the individual proponents of them. Unlike Conformist and
            Self-conscious people, Conscientious adults function well in
            different teams and contexts concentrating on the task or problem to
            be tackled.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Stage 4, people no longer rely so much on others in their
            original in-groups for knowing what to believe and what to do
            (Diplomat). Nor do they derive meaning primarily from their
            professional contexts and craft expertise although those may be
            appreciated like Experts. Rather than relying on knowledge generated
            and received by the thought leaders in their area of interest, now
            they choose how to proceed based on their own critical examination
            of what works, and what it important to know. That extends to the
            conscious choice of what kinds of selves they want to be, what
            values they want to commit to and what purpose they want to enact in
            the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Social context: In general, self-authoring adults realize that they
            need to cooperate with others in order to be successful and to get
            things done. They tend to associate with people who have made
            similar choices about what they deem important to accomplish and the
            kinds of goals they therefore want to pursue and realize. These
            associations reach across differences in upbringing, education,
            race, gender, and personality type. But diversity is not yet
            necessarily valued for its own sake even when it is defended on
            legal terms. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s agree to disagree&rdquo; is a common
            and practical Achiever motto. It allows people to bridge differences
            that could not be crossed at earlier stages. In order to accomplish
            what they feel needs to be done, they join existing groups who share
            their ideals and aspirations. Additionally, they may actively create
            a social entity themselves that fosters their view of reality and
            their dreams of what a better world looks like. Achievers now can
            belong to diverse groups at the same time with different agendas and
            characteristics without feeling torn among them or getting confused
            regarding competing loyalties. They can adjust behavior in order to
            fit in if necessary or take on a leadership position whichever is
            required. Especially in today&rsquo;s electronically interconnected
            world, Stage 4 individuals join together with others in order to
            achieve specific aims. Such relationships are no longer confined by
            geographic proximity. Instead, projects and efforts to change the
            world can now have global participation and a global reach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Achievers often feel an urgency as time is ticking. They are
            preoccupied with getting things done with responsibility,
            conscientiousness and expediency.. They may have a driven quality to
            accomplish something or to improve the world versus the need of
            later stages to develop oneself as an instrument of change. Issues
            of legacy and making a lasting contribution are important to their
            self-image. One hopes to see the results of one&rsquo;s efforts yet
            can envision these also to benefit the next generation. The mood of
            the stage is earnest conviction, seriousness, idealism and
            enthusiasm usually oriented towards action and external targets.
            Those whose proclivity is towards thinking, may create complex
            theories of psychology or philosophy or dedicate themselves to
            research.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscientious persons change others&rsquo; minds by convincing them
            with rational arguments and evidence rather than by putting them
            down. Their self-esteem depends on achieving their own set goals and
            lesser on external affirmation and approval. For all that, the drive
            to succeed and achieve, can readily lead to over-extension and
            exhaustion. Achievers find it difficult to acknowledge their limits
            of time and energy. Engaged in their projects, they hardly slow down
            to look at the present moment, to reflect upon life as a whole, or
            to give themselves a break. They may resent others who make time to
            balance their lives or they may want to learn to do this better
            themselves. Work-life balance issues are among the most common
            complaints of this stage/
          </p>

          <p>
            Given their cognitive capacity, Stage 4 individuals are in love with
            the hypothetical, with theories at the espoused level. They are
            convinced that society can be controlled and improved. They have the
            frame of mind where formal operations are at their peak and
            rationality, progressivism, positivism and reductionism have their
            strongholds. Not knowing or trying to figure things out is not an
            option. If they realize they lack knowledge in a particular area,
            they can admit to it and learn or rely on others who are
            knowledgeable in the area of inquiry.
          </p>

          <p>
            For Conscientious persons in the sciences rationality triumphs! They
            are interested in analysis (ana-lysis = breaking up). Truth can be
            found if diligently pursued, if not now clearly over the long run.
            One can come closer to it by consistently applying the scientific
            method, by looking at things rationally, by continuously improving
            and refining one&rsquo;s methods of inquiry and measuring tools. The
            electron microscope and the telescope are just two such tools that
            let us peer in into the infinitely small and the immeasurably large.
            While Experts tend to rely on authority or received knowledge to
            orient themselves (a renowned expert, or the newest trade journal),
            Conscientious individuals can be skeptical of conventional
            approaches. Researchers at this level are known for their
            intellectual skepticism towards things that are not yet proven.
            However, they do believe that the laws of the universe can be
            figured out eventually and proven.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work: The life of an Achiever is often driven by an urgent sense
            that time is fleeting and that it is therefore a scarce commodity
            one has to use effectively. &ldquo;Time is money.&rdquo; Unlike the
            Expert who is more concerned with individual contributions and in
            perfecting whatever they are tasked with even if it takes forever,
            Achievers are able to prioritize among many tasks and steps in a
            process. They are also now capable of balancing the need for
            effectiveness with a desire for efficiency. The latter often allows
            them to truly delegate tasks to others. They trust that they can do
            a good job despite approaching the assignment differently than the
            delegator. At the same time, Achievers tend to overestimate the
            level of control human beings have. They see it as their role to
            make decisions with the best of intention to serve the greater good.
            Others may experience this as a unilateral and overbearing need for
            control.
          </p>

          <p>
            Achiever values can include alternative life choices in reaction to
            what some perceive as the excessive focus on success at this level.
            &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to run in the Achiever rat race of success
            and money. I prefer to focus on family and a peaceful
            existence.&rdquo; This reaction is not necessarily a matter of
            fundamental disapproval of the Achiever drive, as the alternative
            life choice may be just as driven by a need to be in charge. It is
            important to distinguish between non-conventional and
            postconventional ways of meaning making here. At the conventional
            stages, alternative life style choices are mostly a matter of
            individual preference. The serious questioning of the underlying
            assumptions of the achievement mentality becomes a focus at the
            next, the Individualist stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of their experience of linear time, Achievers sometimes
            acknowledge that they stand on the shoulders of others, that is, if
            they don&rsquo;t revel in their own selfhood and being self-made men
            and women. Being in control is a very powerful aspect of being an
            Achiever and losing control is seen as a major threat to one&rsquo;s
            well-being and self-identity. Thus much energy goes towards reaching
            one&rsquo;s goals and remaining independent. Towards the end of a
            career and looming retirement, this becomes a unique challenge for
            Achievers as having to give up independence feels like losing the
            self
          </p>

          <p>
            Moral: Societal values and morality are internalized if they fit
            self-evaluated standards and one&rsquo;s personality. Conscientious
            persons tend to be self-critical, even hypercritical. They now may
            feel guilt for consequences of actions even when these were
            unintentional or unavoidable. They are self-reliant, conscientious,
            and efficient and preoccupied with attaining goals and ideals. They
            will bend or break rules in order to change social structures and to
            serve the greater good or their need for freedom. Whereas earlier
            stages break rules because they don&rsquo;t like them or because
            they feel constrained by them in what they want to do, Achievers
            often offer valid justifications for doing so.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal style: Conscientious persons have a sense of
            responsibility and obligation towards others even while they pursue
            their own agendas and ideas. They see themselves as indispensable
            and contributing members of the larger community or society, yet
            separate and responsible for their own choices. They are conscious
            of the importance of communication and appreciate the mutual
            expression of differentiated feelings and ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscious preoccupations: Achievement of long term personal goals as
            measured by inner standards is important as are the attaining of
            one&rsquo;s ideals and values. These are often the ones currently
            most salient in the cultural surround. Thus, the money motive and
            the focus on individual success of many Achievers fit very well with
            a capitalistic and the western outlook on reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscientious individuals are often also concerned with motivation
            and reasons for behavior. Many reflect on themselves and express
            more differentiated feelings or can now identify with contradictory
            traits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an optimistic pessimist.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal dimension Achievers are interested in feelings, moods,
            traits, and motivations. &ldquo;Why do I do that? What causes others
            to be what they are and to behave in certain ways? How can I use my
            knowledge of them, to help us achieve our goals? What do I need to
            know and do in order to get along? What can I learn as skills to
            become a better in conflict resolution or team management?&rdquo;
            They are now open to continuous learning and self-improvement in a
            way earlier stages were not. The ways one can be an Achiever is
            astoundingly varied.
          </p>

          <p>
            Decision making: When they take responsibility to do something about
            a recognized problem, they can move with conviction. They are
            concerned with how to get started. &ldquo;How do you get people to
            help? What is the most efficient and effective strategy to get this
            job done?&rdquo; Conscientious persons are willing to take risks and
            to fail to a degree in order to find out. When they are in charge,
            they feel empowered to make unilateral decisions in the perceived
            interest of all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Organizational style: Alliances are task-related or
            problem-oriented. How one relates depends on the specific and
            one&rsquo;s role in the group which changes in different settings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief defenses: Intellectualization, rationalization, suppression of
            shadow are the chief ways the Conscientious person defends against
            doubt and criticism. &ldquo;Better to concentrate on the positive
            and on what can be done than to dwell on the problems and
            difficulties.&rdquo; &ldquo;Better to say, I am sorry later, than
            not to act when opportunity arises.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Depression: Conscientious persons most often suffer depression in
            the form of guilt for not having fulfilled their goals and ideals,
            for the loss of a sense of being able to accomplish them, and the
            ongoing and deep fear of loss of control and autonomy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fear: More even than Self-conscious adults, Conscientious persons
            fear the Conformist frame of mind with its dependency and
            &ldquo;submission.&rdquo; Blind obedience and uncritical absorption
            of ideas is seen as &ldquo;bad-me.&rdquo; Conscientious persons must
            make sure they are not pulled back, unconsciously subsumed in
            someone else&rsquo;s scheme. Fear of loss of progress, control, and
            clear boundaries are overcome with action and relentless forward
            moving.
          </p>

          <p>
            Counseling/coaching style: Similar to Experts, Conscientious persons
            tend to ask lots of questions. However, they also now inquire with
            questions like &ldquo;How is it? What does it feel like?&rdquo; What
            do you imagine would happen if&#8230;?&rdquo;They have a greater
            ability to listen to others&rsquo; experience and play-back
            (restate) expressions without adding their own interpretation. They
            are also able to encourage others to discover their own solutions.
            In general, they are not yet aware of developmental differences and
            may therefore demand behavior that is in over the client&rsquo;s
            head.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Conscientious persons recognize and express
            conceptual complexity and explicitly refer to causal relationship,
            consequences and priorities. We find many terms related to time
            (efficiency, planning, goals, future) as well as implicit references
            to lapse of time (now, used to, when I was a child; is growing).
            Conscientious persons begin to describe themselves as complex
            psychological beings using differentiated psychological vocabulary.
            In MAP protocols one begins to be able to get a sense of the unique
            individual. &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements are revealing, not
            clich&eacute;d, and often contain elements of contrast,
            self-criticism as well as explicit ownership of responsibility.
            Achievers tend to frame choices in contrasting either/or terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The major limitation of the conventional mindset is its acceptance
            of facts and the external world as real and its blindness to the
            acquired nature of their beliefs. They accept the grand myth of
            conventional science that all problems can be solved with the
            appropriate technological inventions, if not yet, certainly in the
            future. Although complex scientific analysis is applied, the
            underlying assumptions of any system are rarely questioned or made
            explicit. Especially at this stage, knowledge, measurement and
            prediction are taken for granted as means to control nature, self
            and society. The attitude of certainty that permeates the Achiever
            mindset, changes dramatically with the move into the next, the first
            postconventional stage of development.
          </p>

          <h3>THE POSTCONVENTIONAL STAGES</h3>

          <p>
            The transition from conventional to postconventional meaning making
            is also signifies an overall, large-scale shift from increasing
            differentiation and the creation of an independent self-identity
            towards increasing integration and deconstruction of the separation
            developed in the first half of the growth trajectory. The visual
            representation of the overall contours of ego development referred
            to in Figure 3 is repeated here as a reminder
          </p>

          <img src="arc2.png" alt="" />

          <p>The arc of adult development (corporate stage names)</p>

          <p>
            The first half of the trajectory &ndash; from Symbiotic embeddedness
            to Achiever independence -- fosters the increasing separation from
            the newborn&rsquo;s union with the mother towards the discrete,
            self-sustaining adult identity with clear boundaries, an self that
            is capable of making reasoned decisions, postpone gratification and
            pursue meaningful goals and purposes. It is this self-governing
            Achiever that is often viewed in the modern world as the fully
            developed &ldquo;adult.&rdquo; The second half of the trajectory
            &ndash; from
          </p>

          <p>
            Pluralist to Unitive -- represents a step-wise deconstruction of the
            sharp and artificially created boundaries towards an ever deeper
            identification with all that exists.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second half can also be likened to an ongoing individuation
            towards a more holistic, full- bodied, and integrated self that is
            fully aware of its interdependence with other systems and one that
            can take a perspective on its fundamental non-separateness. This
            movement can be usefully described in having two layers. A) The
            general systems stages which comprise the first differentiation and
            integration &ndash; from the Individualist-Pluralist to the
            Strategist stage. B) The second differentiation and integration
            &ndash; from the Construct-aware to the Unitive stage. The latter
            two replace Loevinger&rsquo;s Integrated stage (I6 or E9). It is
            likely that Loevinger could not conceive of a self-identity with
            fluid boundaries because it was not part of her psychometric frame
            of reference. She may also not have discovered this kind of open,
            non-delineated self-view because it did not occur in her samples. To
            her, the concept of later stages and ego-transcendence belonged to
            the &ldquo;stratosphere&rdquo; (personal communication 1998).
          </p>

          <h3>A) The General Systems Stages</h3>

          <p>
            At the first postconventional level adults come to realize that the
            meaning of things depends on one&rsquo;s relative position in regard
            to them, that is, on one&rsquo;s personal perspective and
            interpretation of them. Although the objects themselves are seen as
            permanent, their meaning is seen as context- dependent.
            &ldquo;Variables are now seen as interdependent, causality
            experienced as cyclical and boundaries of objects as open and
            flexible&rdquo; (Koplowitz, 1984). It always depends on one&rsquo;s
            definition of what is to be considered within a system or and what
            is outside. This view of reality is called the systems view because
            it allows individuals to look and compare whole systems of thought
            or organizations with increasing distance. Postconventional adults
            can become aware of their own unexamined beliefs. Interest in laying
            bare one&rsquo;s underlying assumptions as well as those of the
            society is an important new capacity at these two new stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Individualist &ndash;Pluralist Stage 4/5 represents systematic
            operations in Commons&rsquo; General Stage Model as a person can now
            look back at the previous belief system as a system. The Autonomous
            Stage 5 expands cognition to metasystematic operations as people at
            this stage are now able to integrate different frameworks of the
            self into a coherent new theory of who they are, that is, into a
            complex, coherent self-identity.
          </p>

          <h3>The Individualist38 &ndash; Pluralist Stage 4/5:</h3>

          <p>
            The Individualist &ndash; Pluralist Stage 4/5 describes what a
            person can &ldquo;see&rdquo; with a fourth person perspective.
            People now realize that things are not necessarily what they seemed
            at earlier stages because the interpretation of reality always
            depends on the position of the observer. Thus the idea of myself as
            a participant observer as well as having multiple perspectives
            becomes fascinating to explore. Once we realize that as observers we
            inevitably influence what we observe, pure, detached, that is,
            &ldquo;objective&rdquo; judgment becomes impossible. This individual
            discovery is supported by more recent challenges to the
            rational/scientific assumptions of the Newtonian world view in both
            the subatomic and the astrophysical sciences. We cannot help but
            filter our observations through our personal and subjective lenses.
            Simultaneously, once we also allow for the validity of others&rsquo;
            personal views and perspectives, we can no longer disregard the
            enormous diversity of people and their beliefs, values and
            preferences. They are all seem equally valid and worthy of
            consideration.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 4th person perspective represents the next differentiation stage
            in the sequence of the stage by stage differentiation-integration
            pattern. It is considered a major watershed in EGO DEVELOPMENT
            THEORY as it signifies the move from conventional to
            postconventional meaning making. Several of the other developmental
            theories consider the next, the Strategist stage, as a more crucial
            transformation. From a meaning making point of view, what is deemed
            most important is simply a matter of emphasis and choice. Overall,
            each new stage represents a new reality for the subject, a new way
            of identifying as a self and of understanding und relating to the
            world.

            The 4th person perspective allows individuals to stand outside the
            system they grew up in and observe themselves and their cultural
            surround from a new altitude. From there one gets a better view of
            the whole valley or plane below. One can look at the familiar
            (status quo) through a new lens and query many of its tacit
            assumptions, values, and beliefs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 4th person perspective allows individuals to focus on
            epistemology, that is, to examine how they came to believe what they
            believe and feel and how one knows and proves things. The transition
            to the first postconventional stage is a watershed in so far as it
            is the first time that the vertical move and the questioning of
            previously unexamined ideas is no longer supported by society and
            its chief conventional representatives. Postconventional thinking
            and questioning assumptions may be taught and encouraged in college
            courses, but then challenged and or dismissed at work and at home.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this stage of differentiation, individuals realize that all
            groups and societies see it as their mandate to mold the minds and
            hearts of their members. What&rsquo;s novel is that they can now
            perceive how much their values and worldviews have been influenced
            by the environments into which they were born, in which they were
            raised, and in which they currently operate. Who we think we are
            depends on the historical context, geographic place, economic
            circumstances, education, the overall structure of the society, and
            many other factors that are part of shaping us. We have far less
            control over being &ldquo;molded&rdquo; than we previously
            understood. Socialization, it turns out, is relentless and ongoing
            from the day we enter the world. It begins with the earliest
            inculcation of what are considered desirable thoughts, feelings,
            values, and behavior and what is not. It continues through schooling
            and is reinforced at every moment via the media, commerce, and, most
            subtly, by the very nature of one&rsquo;s native language and
            communication patterns. While the discursive habit is essential for
            learning and vertical development, it also poses an invisible danger
            by its deep and unconscious place in most people&rsquo;s
            consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            For many the recognition that one&rsquo;s own view of life is not
            the only possible one happens when traveling abroad and encountering
            other peoples and languages. Nowadays, access via television and
            internet to different ways of life and other mores can open ordinary
            people&rsquo;s eyes to diverse perspectives even in the remotest
            corners of the world. This is in striking contrast to earlier
            historical periods when only adventurers dared to hazard abroad and
            often never came back to tell their stories while most ordinary
            denizens had no access to knowledge beyond their immediate local
            communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today&rsquo;s ubiquity and profusion of information, however, cuts
            both ways. English as the dominant language of international
            exchange also acts as powerful indoctrination into Western
            definitions of what adults should strive for, what personal
            attributes will favor success in the world, in short what it means
            to live the good life.39
          </p>

          <p>
            With the turn away from the achievement-orientation and the external
            world towards inner experience -- Individualists and Pluralists
            alike discover how subjective one&rsquo;s perspective is and how
            much of what seemed objective is in the eye of the beholder. The
            move from being unconsciously embedded in a cultural surround to
            having a perspective on it can be both liberating and confusing.
            Liberating because now I am even more able to explore and recognize
            my own unique way of being a human being with new choices and more
            capacity to understand many fascinating aspects of the world.
            Confusing because now there are unlimited ways of perceiving the
            world without any one view better than another. The same
            object/event can have different meanings for different observers,
            for the same observer in different contexts or at different times
          </p>

          <p>
            Stage 4/5 persons become interested in watching themselves trying to
            make sense of themselves. This constitutes an important change in
            thought mode. Individualists-Pluralists abandon purely rational
            analysis in favor of a more holistic, organismic approach in which
            feelings, body sensations and context are taken into account. The
            4th person perspectives allows people to move from merely logical
            thinking to a more subtle, psycho-logical approach. The need to
            reason and to explain everything by rational means lessens.
            Experience itself becomes the new attraction. Thus the process (or
            journey) of discovery is now as more intriguing than reaching a goal
            or creating a product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Individualists and Pluralists tend to distrust conventional wisdom
            and the hyper-rational tenets of the Conscientious stage. At least
            initially, they may reject the Achiever mindset wholesale. They may
            try to distance themselves from all that went before and reject the
            strive-drive values of the prior stage. This demands that they
            reevaluate the soundness of the prefixed role identities that
            society offers and sanctions. One must redefine themselves uniquely
            and independently of these givens based on their own experience,
            values, and conclusions.
          </p>

          <p>
            When one fully realizes that most prior meaning making was socially
            and culturally conditioned, scientific certainty and the judgmental
            frame of mind break down. Moreover, Individualists can learn to
            consciously scrutinize their beliefs in order to test their
            assumptions or to relish the novel mental freedom such a maneuver
            opens up. A big discovery for this stage is the relativity of points
            of view. When people first become aware of this, they may see
            everything as relative and reject any prior certainties including
            scientific knowledge as absolute and therefore &ldquo;false.&rdquo;
            It takes experience at this stage to realize that successful living
            likely requires some of the earlier values. Most individuals need to
            make a living to survive. Sticking with a job one may not totally
            like and getting along with others who do not appreciate constant
            questioning is thus a requirement for most adults no matter how
            creative and postconventional one may be.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Stage 4/5 individuals explore their feelings and motivations,
            they can also begin to become aware of how easily we can fool
            ourselves. The possibility of defensive self-deception and
            culturally- biased distortion are now starting to be experienced as
            ever-present dangers. Given the increasing awareness of one&rsquo;s
            own vulnerabilities, persons at the 4th person perspective can
            exhibit a new, non- hostile type of humor that is directed towards
            the self. It is based on an the beginning sense of the futility of
            framing things in terms of right and wrong, provable or disprovable.
            It also recognizes how easily we can fool ourselves about our
            motives and intentions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognition: With the 4th person perspective, individuals realize that
            things are rarely what they seem. Rather than problems to solve, one
            must figure out what to define as &ldquo;the&rdquo; problem (a
            double loop move). Many things that appear as problems can now be
            seen as polarities to be managed since most values come in pairs.40
            Thus, In the positive, liberated version of this stage, individuals
            may enjoy paradoxes and contradictions and no longer try to explain
            them away. &ldquo;To heck with it! Everything is relative.&rdquo;
            Linear, intellectual logic gives way to a more holistic
            understanding of things. It is not always necessary to prove
            everything in order to embrace it. There is a perception that sudden
            insights and breakthroughs are possible. Playful exploration and
            imagination are set free. Life is fresh and enticing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than trying isolate aspects of experience into different to
            categories and analyze them separately as independent variables,
            Stage 4/5 individuals are looking for connections and subtler clues
            to what is going on. Useful information can come from many sources
            that were previously considered outside the realm of scientific
            inquiry and viewed with skepticism, such as body sensations,
            intuition, dreams, reflection, and meditation. Therefore, the shift
            from conventional to postconventional stages also reflects a
            qualitative shift from a more linear, rational, intellectual to a
            more organismic and embodied awareness. In addition, this new way of
            perceiving can foster the realization that the whole (the Gestalt)
            is more than its separate parts. Therefore attempting to see the
            whole picture with its parts rather than merely parts and the
            details becomes an ever more important consideration with further
            vertical development.
          </p>

          <h3>Individualist expression of the 4th person perspective:</h3>
          <p>
            Rather than trying to analyze everything, Individualists want to
            enjoy their own subjective experience. What can be trusted is
            one&rsquo;s personal experience, sensations, thoughts and feelings
            in the here and now. Thus, there is a major shift from the
            Conscientious person&rsquo;s preference for &ldquo;doing&rdquo; to
            focusing on &ldquo;being and feeling.&rdquo; Instead of marching
            into the future, Individualists become now-oriented. They begin to
            notice how feelings are diffused throughout the body. They can come
            to realize how feelings, thoughts and body sensations affect each
            other. There is a new sense of body/mind connection and a beginning
            understanding of the interwoven, systemic nature of experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Individualists often replace the focus on causality (past) and goals
            (future) of the Conscientious person with a fascination with the
            immediate present. They need to understand and watch how things
            unfold. Their attention turns from outcomes and deliverables to an
            interest in the processes, the relationships and the complex,
            non-linear influences among variables.41 Individualists watch how
            they themselves and other people change and behave differently in
            different contexts. They have an existential appreciation for how
            each moment differs from the next. Therefore the present is newly
            infused with salience and poignancy. Individualists often express
            hope and enthusiasm for their lives and their unique experience that
            others find inspiring. At the same time, they may be so idealistic
            and enamored with their discoveries, they ignore potential
            difficulties or downsides. In that case, others may find them too
            unrealistic, &ldquo;too intense,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;too
            much.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Individualists are often concerned with making a unique and personal
            contribution to the world independent of any socially approved roles
            or tasks. But part of the work as a postconventional adult is to
            discover what that unique purpose may be. They can therefore become
            enthralled with watching themselves trying to make sense of
            themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            They often withdraw from external affairs and company life, or from
            ordinary daily routines. Instead, they turn inward in search of
            their unique gifts or answers to their own burning questions. If
            they are given room to be themselves and time to experiment freely,
            they can provide valuable input to the work- place. They find novel
            ways of looking at problems, or inspire others with their enthusiasm
            in pursuing their own interests and questions. If working
            independently, they are likely to fashion schedules and work
            contexts to optimize their flourishing. Sometimes, they are content
            to simply live day by day following &ldquo;their own drummer.&rdquo;
            Today&rsquo;s hippy culture still embodies some of that sense of
            freedom and self-expression in the company of like-minded others
            symptomatic of the Individualist mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have found in our data that Individualists may or may not have a
            communal bend. Some folks turn towards away from society and focus
            on their own meaning making. They explore their own minds and hearts
            and are less preoccupied with issues of equality and making sure
            that all voices are being heard. While they would not discourage
            such endeavors for those who are into this, it is not where their
            own interests and energies reside. Unlike Experts, they do
            appreciate that others have their own unique ways of doing things
            and being themselves. They recognize that different people have
            different needs and preferences. That includes their personal need
            for now exploring their interiors. They are therefore less apt to
            judge others. Indeed they may at times appear almost
            &ldquo;amoral&rdquo; in their demand to be who they are and do what
            they want.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the extreme, when Individualists overfocus on their inner world
            and the experience of having multiple &ndash; often seemingly
            incompatible -- selves they may express frustration with development
            and ever expanding self-knowledge. The more one explores, the more
            confused one may get. When the overriding feeling becomes
            &ldquo;everything is relative,&rdquo; and &ldquo;there is nothing to
            hold on to,&rdquo; cynicism and nihilism can become a way to defend
            against the feeling of being adrift on a vast unknown sea unmoored
            and rudderless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identity: While some people at Stage 4/5 relish inconsistencies as
            proof of the illogical nature of conventional beliefs42, others at
            this stage may become confused by observing the many contradictions.
            They often describe themselves as having subpersonalities, many
            voices, or as an &ldquo;inner tribe.&rdquo; These voices cannot be
            readily synthesized into a coherent self-identity. &ldquo;Sometimes
            I act, feel and think one way, other times in another depending on
            all sorts of conditions: my mood, how well I have slept, what
            context I was in. There is a struggle within myself, different
            voices competing for attention. And all seem real and important
            parts of me. Who am I? What is going on? How can anyone tell with
            certainty who they really are as they are changing and
            growing?&rdquo; Thus, the prevalent anxiety of Stage 4/5 is around
            integrating different parts of oneself. &ldquo;I can be both my old
            rational self, and a new, different kind of person; I am afraid I
            have multiple personalities. I feel confused, split,
            ambivalent.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of the imagined greater integration and harmony, the 4th
            person perspective and experience may feel like a cacophony rather
            than a symphony. Depression at this level has several facets: a) The
            realistic fear of being reabsorbed, that is sucked back into the
            &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; of the Achiever mindset by the demands of
            society; b) The dread of a routine work life that does rarely allows
            for individual self-expression and creativity; c) The concern that
            one will never find a clear self-definition from which to
            consistently operate and generate a coherent self sense; d) The deep
            experience of worry and tensions that come from growing beyond the
            conventional mindset especially when it comes to intimate
            relationships.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experience of looking at the world with different eyes than
            those that used to be one&rsquo;s closest allies, such as a spouse
            or a long-term friend, can create great distress for both parties.
            While the conventional partner is confused about the new way of
            behaving of the person with the 4th person perspective, those who
            are postconventional feel misunderstood and un-appreciated for what
            they now feel they have to offer. The latter also often wish for the
            significant other to become more like themselves. This, in turn, can
            make the person &ldquo;left behind&rdquo; feel disrespected and
            misunderstood. In this sense, the move of one partner from
            conventional to postconventional meaning making poses a particular
            challenge to couples and long-term relationships. Unlike later
            stages, early postconventional individuals cannot yet fully
            appreciate the gifts of the earlier levels. They genuinely feel that
            if only others -- including their loved ones -- would become more
            like themselves, then everybody would be happier and the whole world
            would be better place.
          </p>

          <h3>Pluralist expression of 4th person perspective</h3>

          <p>
            Pluralists, on the other hand, tend to focus on the multiplicity of
            voices and contexts. Aware of their own views as interpretations,
            they do not want to impose these on others. They seek instead to
            respect and understand all positions. Individual differences are
            celebrated and paid attention to in a way that
          </p>

          <p>
            Achievers cannot yet appreciate. The very differences become the
            center of attention now rather than being bracketed out in order to
            &ldquo;manage&rdquo; the differences in order to reach an agreed
            upon goal. When a group of mostly Pluralists get together, they
            often make room for everybody to express their positions and
            opinions as each person&rsquo;s view is considered equally genuine
            and valid from their own point of view as well as a crucial aspect
            of the overall diversity in the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tendency, to treat every opinion with the same regard can be
            driven to an extreme. In societies, organizations or teams where
            everybody&rsquo;s voice is given equal opportunity for expression,
            meetings can run on forever and little gets resolved or
            accomplished. The over-focus on fairness and voice, can lead to
            &ldquo;decision paralysis&rdquo; as no one dares to take a lead
            role, assert a position, or make an executive decision for fear to
            be seen as unilateral, uncooperative, or oppressive. Indeed, it is
            one of the more problematic attributes of many proponents of radical
            pluralism that they judge all hierarchies as oppressive. They cannot
            recognize that decision paralysis is its own form of oppression and
            constraint. On the positive side, especially those individuals who
            were or felt marginalized in the past may feel acknowledged and
            heard for the first time.

            Above all, an awareness of human diversity and multiple perspectives
            is the powerful and progressive contribution that this stage has
            brought to human affairs. Moreover, the egalitarian emphasis of the
            Pluralist worldview is an important step towards further
            differentiation and integration. Although it is difficult for Stage
            3/4 and Stage 4 people to tolerate committed Pluralists with their
            egalitarian fervor, Pluralists have prepared the way for an even
            deeper appreciation and tolerance of difference, one that allows for
            making qualitative distinctions as well as for cherishing human
            diversity. This more discerning and flexible view becomes possible
            at the next, the Strategist stage. To differentiate this capacity
            from the Pluralist perspective, an individual at the next level can
            prioritize among voices because they recognize that some views are
            based on better evidence and take more aspects of a situation into
            account.

          <p>
            When Loevinger created her original theory in the sixties and
            seventies, a focus on diversity and equality of perspectives was at
            the forefront of social thought. People who dedicated themselves to
            bringing diversity issues into the public discourse were therefore
            deemed postconventional. In the meantime, diversity and equality
            concerns are mentioned at all levels of development because they
            have become anchored in the law. Therefore mere mentioning of
            diversity and gender equality no longer indicates postconventional
            development. Especially when Achievers and Experts execute diversity
            trainings, even with the best of intentions, they may focus so much
            on the differences to be valued that the bonds of our common
            humanity can get overlooked in the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            A special case of pluralism is the academic discipline of
            deconstructive postmodernism. It beliefs that it is impossible to
            defend any belief by proclaiming that all views are subjective and
            therefore legitimate since everything is relative. When relativism
            is carried to its logical extreme no view or interpretation is
            better than any other. All are equal. Postmodernists believe that
            any metanarrative succumbs to the same subjective arbitrariness.
            They deny the legitimacy of all hierarchies and all hierarchical
            ordering. When Pluralists adopt this belief, they may be
            hypersensitive to perceived instances of judgment as
            &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; in human terms.
            According to Wilber, radical postmodernism leads to what he calls
            &ldquo;Boomeritis (2003).&rdquo; In the extreme case, postmodernists
            assert with absolute certainty that there is no position from which
            to judge anything. They do not yet recognize the inherent
            self-contradiction in their assertion. It is, of course, a form of
            judgment and hierarchical ordering of values as those who disagree
            clearly have a less evolved view from theirs.

          <p>
            Social: The very heightened capacity to contact the self and to
            introspect leads to a greater capacity to empathize with others and
            to tolerate different ideas, behaviors and reactions. Stage 4/5
            individuals are often admired by others, especially by other
            postconventional persons, for their unconcerned, energetic
            self-expression, their spontaneity, and their ability to live a life
            according to their own unique style free from restrictive
            conventions. At the same time, they may be feared as unpredictable
            or dismissed as dreamers and non-doers, especially in an
            strive-drive Achiever context. Their relationships with others are
            intense and mutually rewarding when there is synergy and choice.
            When they have to manage others as part of a job, they can be
            autocratic or idiosyncratic to such a degree, that others find them
            &ldquo;impossible to nail down&rdquo;, &ldquo;aloof and
            unapproachable &rdquo; or simply &ldquo;wishy- washy.&rdquo; One
            never knows where one stands with such a leader.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal dimension: Individuals are deeply concerned with their
            interiors, with feelings and motiva- tions. They show a beginning
            awareness of inner conflict and ambivalence as natural aspects of
            reality and of the potential for defensive self-deception and
            culturally biased distortion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive level: Things are not always what they seem. One&rsquo;s
            interpretation of the world depends largely on one&rsquo;s position
            as an observer. One is always a participant observer. One can never
            be totally detached or &ldquo;objective.&rdquo; The same object has
            a different meaning for different observers. Individuals abandon
            purely rational analysis in favor of a more holistic, organismic
            approach in which multiple perspectives and interpretations as well
            as the context are taken into account. Mature Individualists-
            Pluralists can integrate and bridge rational thought with non-linear
            approaches to getting information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prevalent anxiety: &ldquo;I can be both my old rational self, and a
            new, different kind of person; I am afraid I can&rsquo;t figure out
            who I really am. I feel confused, split, ambivalent.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Depressive style: Inner conflict and despair about ever finding
            one&rsquo;s true self.
          </p>

          <p>
            Preoccupation: Rather than trying to analyze everything, State 4/5
            individuals want to enjoy the subjective experience, their unique
            way of making sense of things. It is all that can be trusted. They
            are newly focused with being and feeling rather than with doing and
            achieving. Instead of marching into the future, individuals become
            now-oriented as they infuse experience in the present with
            importance. The past is gone and the future cannot really be known.
            Meaning making has shifted from an analytical - intellectual to a
            more organismic, somatic and holistic mode of understanding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personality types: Individualists often prefer to live at the fringe
            of society, to live exactly the way they want to be. Admired by
            postconventional people for their spontaneity and unique
            self-expression, conventional persons may distrust them for being
            non-conformist and impossible to understand and predict. Avowed
            Pluralists can be powerful advocates for tolerance and equality, but
            also get hung up in endless discussions and overprivileging
            diversity to the neglect of our common humanity
          </p>

            Language clues: The Syntax of the 4th person perspective contains
            many contingencies, non-banal qualifications, and several
            contrasting ideas. &ldquo;Even though, despite, nonetheless,
            ,&rdquo; signal beginning greater cognitive complexity and replace
            &ldquo;but&rdquo; and &ldquo;or.&rdquo; Individuals can now
            entertain contradicting ideas and join them by
            &ldquo;both/and&rdquo; and &ldquo;while.&rdquo; The writings contain
            vivid personal information (often punctuated with exclamation marks)
            and more nuanced psychological vocabulary and comments on their own
            responses to the MAP. MAP protocols show a distinct emphasis and
            &ldquo;need&rdquo; for unique self- expression, a vivid sense of
            released energy and individuality. The verbal rejection of gender
            items and other prompts in sentence completions such as ,&ldquo;How
            can I generalize?&rdquo; or &ldquo;it all depends&rdquo; indicate
            beginning awareness of relativity of point of view and the nature of
            generalization.

          <h3>The Autonomous Stage 5: (Strategist)</h3>

          <p>
            The Autonomous stage represents an enlarged fourth person
            perspective which places the individual&rsquo;s experience into the
            context of multiple worldviews and within people&rsquo;s whole
            lifetime. Cognitively Autonomous persons have a general systems view
            of reality, that is, they can comprehend multiple interconnected
            systems of relationships and processes both internally and
            externally as these are experienced as connected.
          </p>

          <p>Expanded 4th person perspective:</p>

          <p>
            The self as in embedded in history and multiple cultural contexts
          </p>

          <p>
            Embrace: like-principled others and a broad range of human beings
            and their many ways.
          </p>

          <p>Time frame: &ldquo;historical perspective, lifetime view&rdquo;</p>

          <p>
            Cognition: general systems view internalized, metasystematic = able
            to compare and coordinate multiple systems
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief concern: development of self and others, self- actualization,
            integration, beginning to own shadow
          </p>

          <p>
            Positive expression: Well balanced, tolerant, insightful,
            growth-oriented; committed to improving the lot of all stakeholders
          </p>

          <p>
            Truth: can be approximated; higher is better since not all arguments
            and positions are of equal quality. Higher is more flexible and thus
            more adequate to deal with complexities of all kinds.
          </p>

          <p>
            The expanded 4th person perspective is now truly world-centric.
            While earlier stages may express world-centric values and goals,
            Strategists embrace the tenets of a global worldview and can embody
            them. They have internalized systems thinking. They not only see the
            interconnected aspects of the external world, but also that of their
            own meaning making. With the expanded time frame and wider social
            networks, Autonomous persons can perceive systemic patterns or
            long-term trends and are often valued for that
            &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; capacity and vision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of its global understanding and the long-term sense of
            oneself as part of ongoing history, this stage parallels the
            &ldquo;integral&rdquo; or yellow stage in Wilber&rsquo;s AQAL
            theory. As mentioned earlier, the LMF emphasizes the cognitive move
            from linear to systems thinking as a watershed in meaning making
            while Integral theory focuses on the qualitatively new capacity to
            see the world and oneself through an evolutionary lens. The
            Autonomous stage is the first level that fully recognizes the need
            and value for the existence of all stages both in terms of diversity
            in society as well as in terms of one&rsquo;s own development. At
            least, in the ideal. The human tendency to want to be among similar
            people and to affirm one&rsquo;s own worldview can easily lead to
            new forms of feeling superior and pride as a member of a chosen or
            special &ldquo;tribe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Autonomous persons realize that they may notice different
            conflicting aspects in themselves at different times and in
            different contexts. However, -- unlike Individualists, who may
            despair about ever knowing who they really are -- they are capable
            of &ldquo;owning&rdquo; and integrating many disparate parts of
            themselves. This includes integrating previously compartmentalized
            sub-identities, and rejected or marginalized parts of themselves.
            The experience of being part of interlocking systems rather than a
            bunch of separate agents changes one&rsquo;s sense of responsibility
            in conflict situations. One sees how one inevitably is part of and
            contributes consciously or unconsciously to them. The self and the
            other can be seen as both perpetrator and victim, giver and taker,
            product and process as actions, thoughts and feelings can no longer
            be isolated as was the preferred way of dealing with difficulties at
            the Achiever level. Instead they form a dynamic interplay.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loevinger called this stage &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; because
            individuals can now make meaning autonomously, independent of
            conventional ideas. While one cannot change reality, one has the
            freedom to interpret it to serve one&rsquo;s own preferences and to
            make choices about life and who one wants to be. This is possible
            now precisely because one fully understands that interpreting and
            evaluating is what human beings do to make sense of experience. We
            all tell stories about what is happening, who does what to whom, how
            we see life overall, and why we believe that we matter. Autonomous
            persons consciously commit to create a meaningful life for
            themselves and for others in the world through self-determination
            and self-actualization. They realize that the way they tell their
            life stories changes with additional experiences and insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            The crucial new capacity is to realize one&rsquo;s power to generate
            meaning and to tell a coherent self- story by creating it. Unlike
            people at Stage 4/5 who are not able to integrate various parts of
            themselves, Stage 5 representatives feel empowered to do so. Thus,
            Strategist possess a relatively strong, autonomous self sense that
            is both differentiated and well integrated. It is different from the
            Achiever sense of authorship because it is much more aware of the
            limits of one&rsquo;s control. At the same time, Strategists embrace
            the options for self-realization they have and see the limits to
            their power as part of what it means to be alive. With their sense
            of transformational mission comes set of broader, human principles
            one must uphold such as the right of all human beings to be treated
            with justice and mercy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Autonomous persons worry most about having failed to observe those
            universal principles they value deeply such as the right of all
            people to self-determination and for being treated with dignity and
            respect.
          </p>

          <p>
            With their expanded awareness, Strategist use even more channels of
            information to make their moves. They are often conscious of energy
            dynamics (physical and otherwise), and notice underlying patterns
            that only emerge over longer period of time. They also have a deeper
            appreciation than any prior stage of how challenging it is to be a
            mature, responsible adult and how rare their own capacities are
            compared with most other people they are in contact with. Thus, they
            may pride themselves of being in the know about themselves and about
            the larger issues facing the world. Whatever their personal
            expertise, it is likely enhanced by interpersonal skills and worldly
            savvy based on having learned from experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strategist are often motivated and infused with a grand purpose and
            a vision of what could be. Unlike Pluralists and Individualists,
            however, their enthusiasm is based on high ideals as well as on a
            more realistic view of what it takes to change old patterns in self,
            in organizations, and in society.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strategists want to hone themselves therefore as instruments of
            change. They realize that they need to be the most they can in order
            to be of most service to others. Both servant and steward leadership
            are part of one&rsquo;s care for the larger system and future
            generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wanting to help others evolve is one of the strongest motivators for
            Autonomous persons. Humanists, developmental psychologists, coaches
            and consultants often inhabit this stage. So do Strategist
            executives and leaders who see human beings as precious capital and
            who take multiple bottom lines into account in measuring their
            organizations&rsquo; success. In the best work place scenario,
            tangible as well as intangible outcomes are taking into
            consideration by paying attention to the physical and mental health
            of the staff, to an aesthetic work environment, to a good work-life
            balance, as well as to serving the wider community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strategists conceive of developing people as a valuable contribution
            to the individuals themselves as well as to society. When this need
            to have others &ldquo;become the most they can be&rdquo; encounters
            resistance, Autonomous persons may feel impatient with others&rsquo;
            pace of development and frustrated with their
            &ldquo;unwillingness&rdquo; to grow despite their efforts and
            support. This need to have others transform is one of the central
            flaws of this stage along with an attachment to knowing and being
            coherent.
          </p>

          <p>
            They also tend to be among those who are most convinced that higher
            development is &ldquo;always&rdquo; better and should be fostered at
            all cost. Higher is believed to be better because the more
            autonomous and insightful about their inner dynamics individuals
            become, the more they can claim that they have an objective
            (non-distorted) and realistic self-identity (Kegan, 1982). This is
            the case even though this is also the first stage that can see how
            all people have had to move along the developmental trajectory
            through the various stages to be where they are now. Autonomous
            individuals also understand, at least theoretically, that this
            happens at a different pace and to a different degree for different
            people depending on life circumstances and appropriate challenge and
            support. Developmental thinking is now an aspect of cognition, of
            being able to look back and see how one evolved from a totally
            ego-centric and self-protective, to an ethnocentric, to a global or
            world-centric perspective.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many Autonomous persons see life as an open-ended journey. They
            believe that there is no predetermined way to follow for all human
            beings. Each individual has to find and create his/her own life
            style and is responsible for his or her own self-fulfillment.
            Autonomous individuals are interested in psychological questions and
            how to come to terms with inner conflict. Unlike individuals at the
            conventional stages, seeking therapy, advice, or consulting from
            others, is not seen as a weakness, but as a necessity and an actual
            strength. Autonomous persons have faith in their own and other
            people&rsquo;s capacity to make meaning out of challenges and
            difficulties. They can construe their own personal sense without
            having to impose it on all others. They may also invite
            others&rsquo; solutions to conflict and respect their needs for
            autonomy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes Autonomous persons find ordinary constraints of life
            stultifying such as making a living and working an eight-hour day.
            They see themselves as being destined for bigger tasks with a far-
            reaching impact different from ordinary folks. They would prefer to
            enjoy their passions for influence and power on their own terms with
            maximal freedom or a mandate to do so for the benefit of all. If
            leading an organization to greatness is one of those passions, it
            may be a fortuitous match.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive: With the expansion of the 4th person perspective in time
            (historical) and space (global) Strategists are able to operate from
            multiple levels and perspectives. They have fully shifted to a
            systems awareness while appreciating the benefits of a traditional
            scientific linear view of reality. They can value and apply both
            conventional and postconventional practices without having to reject
            the former in order to feel like themselves. They also recognize
            natural hierarchies in life. They are no longer afraid of
            acknowledging that some members of society are better equipped for
            certain tasks, or more cognitively differentiated than others. The
            Strategist embraces the notion that all human beings deserve
            respect, but also knows that not all opinions and all perspectives
            deserve the same attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike Pluralists, Strategists can now prioritize among multitude of
            voices because they recognize that some views are based on better
            evidence as well as being more comprehensive and fruitful than
            others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Making informed strategic decisions is part of the Strategist
            leader&rsquo;s power. She chooses who of the pivotal stake holders
            to involve when decisions have to be made on an issue that requires
            others&rsquo; input. Society sometimes recognizes as valuable the
            capacity of the Strategist to make difficult decisions and to
            compare and integrate multiple perspectives. Furthermore, Autonomous
            persons have become aware of the performative contradiction of the
            postmodernist&rsquo;s position and assertion that there is no
            position from which to judge anything. They realize that assessing,
            evaluating and choosing are vital aspects of functioning and making
            sense of life. They distinguish between biased judging and wise
            discernment. Whereas one has to be on the alert to avoid bias and
            notice one&rsquo;s evaluative preferences, judging itself is crucial
            in human affairs.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is at the Strategist stage, that individuals begin to see paradox
            and ambiguity as an inevitable dimension of living and to
            increasingly tolerate these. Autonomous persons become aware and
            fluent in using polarity thinking in order to examine issues and
            tensions. Complex and sustainable solutions often require that one
            pays attention to opposing but interdependent values. The most
            effective and healthy designs foster the wisdom aspects of both
            poles and the minimize their downsides.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the belief that one can at least approximate an accurate
            picture of the territory with diligence and through dialogue and
            collaboration is still prevalent. Autonomous individuals are aware
            of multiple interrelated systems and how influences are circular,
            cyclical and often tapestry -like. They have beginning access to an
            understanding of life that can integrate psycho-logically
            paradoxical elements. Therefore, less energy needs to be spent on
            &ldquo;defending.&rdquo; This then allows Strategists to be more
            accepting and spontaneous than adults at earlier stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emotional: For the Autonomous person inner processes are
            fascinating, complex and demanding to explore. As much as they need
            others, they also need privacy and time for self-reflection. The
            self is experienced as in transformation and constantly reappraised.
            Watching this &ldquo;unfolding&rdquo; of things is one of the main
            satisfactions at this stage. One&rsquo;s precious life work consists
            in trying &ldquo;to become the most one can become&rdquo; in
            contrast to the goal of Achievers hoping to be the best one can be.
            In the Strategist&rsquo;s eyes, good company, good questions,
            intimate relationships, and a meaningful occupation as well as
            chances for self-actualization and self-fulfillment are essential
            for a meaningful existence. Others are valued as ongoing, vital
            co-actors in one&rsquo;s own fascinating life drama.
          </p>

          <p>
            Autonomous persons become fine-tuned to their own psychological
            well-being and inner workings. They take responsibility for
            regulating their thoughts, feelings and behavior. They are
            responsive and adjust when required as part of different life
            contexts and career phases. Deeper life purpose and legacy issues
            become an important topics of concern. How does my life and my
            contribution matter beyond my life time and my immediate realm of
            influence?
          </p>

          <p>
            Relativism changes into personal commitment and responsibility for
            creating one&rsquo;s own personal meaning. Individuals are now
            capable of rediscovering and owning parts of the self which have
            previously been disowned for being too confusing or too threatening.
            The shadow side of the self can be acknowledged to a greater degree
            and therefore a new integration and wholeness is possible. Although
            Autonomous folks experience role conflicts and dilemmas strongly,
            they recognize that these are inescapable and that ambivalent
            feelings are natural. Based on this capacity to integrate and take a
            metasystematic view of different parts of experience, they tend to
            be quite certain of themselves and their cognitive and emotional
            capacity for synthesis and integration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike individuals at the later, the postautonomous stages of
            meaning making, Autonomous persons try very hard to keep their act
            together and to come across as reasonable, mature, and knowing
            themselves well. They feel responsible for being able to orchestrate
            conflicting needs and different subidentities and generally appear
            more balanced than earlier stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strategists sometimes present themselves as exemplars of humanity
            giving off a whiff of superiority. Now even failures and missteps
            are presented as positive aspects of learning. While reframing and
            retelling one&rsquo;s story in a more positive, self-sustaining
            light is a great strength of this stage, the capacity of owning some
            of one&rsquo;s failures and foibles, can be used by the ego to
            bolster its sense of achievement and importance. We call this the
            whitewashing tendency of the Strategist. &ldquo;Look how well I know
            myself. I am not afraid to share even my less than stellar sides so
            you can learn Although not inevitable, feeling powerful and
            insightful because one understands so much about human nature and
            the world can lead to self-inflation. The focus on
            &ldquo;humility&rdquo; that several leadership studies mention as an
            important aspect of good stewardship is likely a response to this
            observation. On the other hand, it is a great triumph over earlier
            stages, that at this level one can recognize that flaws are part of
            being human. Getting a perspective on them is a life-long invitation
            to deepening one&rsquo;s self- awareness and connection to others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal: Even more than at the Individualist stage,
            experiences of all kinds can be welcomed and accepted for their
            immediate qualities. Distressing emotions become more tolerable and
            offer insights that can be heeded. Strong positive and negative
            feelings can be acknowledged within oneself and shared with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Self and others are accepted as complex human beings with both
            positive and problematic traits and dispositions. There is an
            infinite variety of unique expressions of being a self. Only the
            dynamic and intimate exchange with others makes it possible to get
            in touch with aspects of one&rsquo;s behavior one would otherwise
            tend to overlook. Good feedback makes one aware of what one is
            defending or blind to. Feedback is vital for continuing development
            and for gaining ever deeper self-knowledge and wisdom. One needs
            both the caring and the critical presence of others to optimize
            oneself as an instrument of change. The deep sense of
            interdependence creates a need to be mutually supportive and
            challenging. Strategists may feel responsible to help others
            transform in order to fulfill what they intuit as other&rsquo;s
            potential.
          </p>

          <p>
            The &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; or &ldquo;evolutionary&rdquo;
            fervor of this level is occasionally blind to the
            transformer&rsquo;s own identification with and self-importance in
            being a &ldquo;transformer.&rdquo; Many well-meaning change agents
            are not aware of the potential disregard for the needs and capacity
            of the recipients in their efforts to help others grow. Strategists
            can sometimes show impatience with others&rsquo; slow development,
            and frustration with their perceived resistance to grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding, many seasoned Autonomous persons are ever more
            capable of expressing tolerance and non-possessive love (or being
            love) because of their profound appreciation of other people in
            their own right as unique individuals and as adults with a growing
            consciousness as well as fellow human beings with whom one shares
            the human plight. Others are seen as actors in their own life
            dramas, which are deeply moving and fascinating to participate in.
            Beginning with this stage, benevolence towards others and increasing
            compassion for oneself can become an abiding attitude.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emotional: Autonomous persons have now access to a wide range of
            different emotions and different states of awareness. Their
            emotional tone is different from that of Individualists. It is often
            less cynical and distrusting, more upbeat and also again more
            certain about oneself and knowing. Feeling into various sensations
            and emotions is one of the ways one approaches any experience.
            Rational deliberation and objective analysis are fully integrated
            into a comprehensive approach to problem definition and solving.
            Strategists can also recognize subtle distinctions among similar
            feelings. Thus,t hey would likely distinguish between various kinds
            of sorrow, grief, regret, disappointment etc. Overall, they seek to
            claim an authentic, truthful and adaptive self. Authenticity, is
            therefore an important value in the Strategist&rsquo;s value
            repertoire.46
          </p>

          <p>
            The greater awareness of their inner depth also allows Autonomous
            persons to use dreams, fantasy, and imagination much more freely
            than earlier stages. Their thoughts are allowed to take off.
            Strategist seek creative, integrated solutions to large-scale and
            long-term problems. More even than Individualists, they can think
            outside the box. Their imagination is no longer constrained by
            conventional approaches while these are taken into account and not
            ignored or resisted as at the previous stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strong feelings are becoming of interest as indicators of something
            important to observe in oneself and others. Autonomous persons can
            see difficulties as a natural part of the human condition --
            inherent in the dynamic interplay of multiple systems and of complex
            human interactions. Thus they are often more skilled at negotiating
            impasses and conflicts because they are not as likely as all earlier
            stages to use blaming as a defense. They can identify with others
            and appreciate their vulnerabilities as well as their unique
            strengths. Because they are aware of their own many shortcomings,
            hang-ups, preferences and less than ideal habits, they can express
            light-hearted humor directed at our general folly as human beings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moral: Strategists genuinely feel principled anger and righteous
            indignation towards the injustices of the world. They will stand up
            against society to express their personal convictions or to uphold
            their higher, overarching principles regarding human rights and
            well- being. They are willing to go on the barricades and risk their
            lives and reputations in order to fulfill the aims of their
            convictions. Their anger does not usually seek a victim but is
            geared towards rectifying perceived ills. Because of their capacity
            for the long-term view and they often express a deep concern for the
            well-fare of future generations. They feel a challenge and the
            obligation to make wise decisions that will serve beyond their own
            time and region. Self-less sacrifice for the greater good can thus
            be part of an Autonomous person&rsquo;s positive
            self-identification.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Strategist&rsquo;s standards for living a meaningful life are
            elf-evaluated and internalize. &ldquo;To walk the talk&rdquo;
            becomes an expression of one&rsquo;s moral character and
            authenticity. One&rsquo;s behavior becomes an expression of
            one&rsquo;s moral principles and convictions. When irreconcilable
            role conflicts are discovered, there may be a deep unease and yet
            also a greater tolerance for feeling dissatisfied, ambivalent or
            confused than at earlier levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            One must qualify this statement because total acceptance of what is,
            is not yet part of the Strategist mindset. A serious effort towards
            even greater self-knowledge and self-management skills remains a
            facet of an Autonomous person&rsquo;s ideal self-image and drive
            towards human perfection. When they seek to become enlightened, they
            may make an enduring effort to &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; that goal with
            great seriousness and diligence. They may spend years in regular
            meditation practice, attending retreats, and following a particular
            spiritual leader or contemplative school. They may not fully realize
            that their very efforting is in contradiction with accepting what
            is. The tension between effort towards achieving a goal, even a
            spiritual one, and acceptance of what is may intensify at the next
            level of development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Autonomous persons become charismatic moral leaders who inspire
            others to follow their great vision of an ideal world order and a
            world fit for generations to come. When they defend what they
            believe to be a worthy cause, they can be courageous and disregard
            negative consequences for themselves. But they may also be overly
            forceful with their convictions especially when they are fueled by
            principled anger. The combination of charisma, moral conviction and
            interpersonal skills can be a dangerous combination if not kept in
            check. Followers often do not have the wherewithal to see the
            limitations and possible self-serving aspects of such a leader and
            his or her inspiring ideas.47
          </p>

          <p>
            Depression: Autonomous individuals become dissatisfied with their
            lives when they feel they have not fulfilled their unique human
            promise or when they have not lived up to the greatness they expect
            of themselves. Loss of courage as well as loss of a sense of
            self-agency and power can become great stressors. When using
            defenses, healthy Autonomous persons use mostly mature ones such as
            suppression, altruism, humor, and reframing. When they use less
            mature defenses, they may realize it as momentary fallback. They may
            therefore be able to see this behavior as context-dependent and are
            able to forgive themselves and move on. However, when they think
            they have failed in their precious life work and mission, they can
            despair and feel a deep sense loss of self.
          </p>

          <p>
            This shift from feeling in one&rsquo;s full power to feeling no
            longer needed is especially common when Strategists approach
            retirement. There has been much ongoing gratification in being
            successful in their m&eacute;tier, in having raised a family
            (whether as a personal one, as a thought leader, or as a leader of
            an enterprise), and in feeling one has made a difference in the
            world. The question of one&rsquo;s worth in one&rsquo;s older, less
            engaged years looms large. Did one get the rewards and appreciation
            one was hoping for and if so, will it remain? How does one relax and
            trust that the next generation will reign as well and as consciously
            and learn from their mistakes along the way? One way of dealing with
            these questions is to take on the role of mentor or steward of
            younger leaders or an organization. When less well navigated, the
            perceived lack of engagement with others and/or the lack of a sense
            of being as loved and admired as one expected, can lead to sadness
            or even bitterness. Ideally, the sense of disappointment can be
            mitigated with self-compassion and an understanding of life&rsquo;s
            whole trajectory &ndash; with its inevitable ups and downs, triumphs
            and losses, and with its beginning, middle and end.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpersonal style: One takes responsibility for relationships
            while also requiring autonomy and personal space. Relationships are
            seen in terms of inevitable mutual interdependence. One can tolerate
            and appreciate others&rsquo; autonomy and their different solutions
            to conflict. Non-hostile, existential humor is beginning to be
            available in tense situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cognitive level: The time frame and social context are expanded to
            include multiple systems and complex relationships among self,
            others, systems and global contingencies. These often contradict
            each other. As a result, Strategists develop a new capacity and
            strength to see and embrace paradox and insolvable issues as part of
            a realistic appraisal of situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internal dimension: One can now make sense of oneself in terms of
            inner conflict and &ldquo;polarities&rdquo;. Strategists try to
            integrate into a coherent whole what they see as their different
            selves at different times in different circumstances. Self-identity
            is a creative act of integration based on a new sense of being
            embedded in a global context and a life-time sense of unfolding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscious preoccupation: Strategists are concerned with
            self-actualization, self-fulfillment, and legacy issues. They are
            interested in the psychology of self and coming to terms with their
            preferences and conflicting needs .
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief anxiety: a) not to fulfill one&rsquo;s personal potential, b)
            not to self-actualize, c) not to live up to or neglect those global
            principles of justice, tolerance etc. one holds dear above any
            others, and d) loss of courage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Defenses: Mostly mature ones: suppression, positive reframing,
            altruism, and non hostile humor When using less mature defenses, one
            can be forgiving and understanding towards the ego
          </p>

          <p>
            Representatives: Charismatic individuals who are ready for personal
            sacrifice in order to defend through personal example the moral
            principles they believe in. Visionary leaders with the capacity to
            see how systems interrelate and are aware of the long-term
            implications of their choices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Autonomous persons use a complex, flexible syntax;
            with a wide array of topics and concerns. They try to do justice to
            the complexity of life in their verbal expressions. They try to
            present a coherent exposition of their thinking and themselves. They
            use differentiated psychological vocabulary and understand circular
            causality in human relations. &ldquo;Authenticity, evolution,
            transformation, higher principles, life purpose, authenticity and
            self-fulfillment&rdquo; are among favored concepts.
            &ldquo;Both/and&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; thinking
            is used in combination or alone depending on the context.
          </p>

          <h3>B) The Postautonomous Stages</h3>

          <p>
            The next two stages in the sequence represent the final steps in the
            ongoing movement of differentiation and integration from stage to
            stage that I observed in my studies of the evolution of the self
            through sentence completions. These last two stages are based on the
            sparse but telling evidence from these as well as on personal
            encounters with individuals at these levels. Few people develop a
            fifth person perspective and even fewer gain an ego transcendent or
            a Unitive view as a permanent place from which to metabolize
            experience and witness the process of meaning making itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            These two advanced stages represent qualitatively new ways of seeing
            reality and experiencing life and the self. They replace
            Loevinger&rsquo;s vague Integrated stage (I-6, E9). Her theory of
            identity formation describes an ever more clearly defined and
            delineated self-identity. She held a view of ego integration that
            could not conceive of the possibility of the transcendence of both
            self-boundaries and the need for a permanent self-identity.
            Cognitively, the last differentiation represents cross-paradigmatic
            capacity operations. Any further differentiation within the same
            paradigm of increasing hierarchical complexity is reaching is
            manifest limits. Only the creation of a new way of knowing can
            hierarchically supersede and integrate all previous knowledge and
            ways of knowing in the symbol-mediated, personal world of meaning
            making.
          </p>

          <p>
            The two postautonomous stages are called Construct-aware or
            Ego-aware, and Unitive respectively. 48 Now people come to realize
            that all objects are human-made constructs, including for instance
            such abstract constructs as purpose, linear time and the ego. All
            are based on layers upon layers of symbolic abstraction. Even such
            an everyday concept as a &ldquo;bed&rdquo; is an enormous
            simplification. No two people&rsquo;s mental picture of a bed is
            alike and no two beds in the world are identical. And yet we all use
            the term &ldquo;bed&rdquo; and it works well for most purposes of
            communication. To become cognizant of the pitfalls of the language
            habit as well as its tremendous gift to humanity, is a unique
            feature of the the most advanced ego stages.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the first postautonomous stage, the conventional belief into a
            permanent object world and the idea of a clearly delineated and
            achievable self-identification begins to be questioned and
            investigated. The arbitrariness of labeling reality is recognized as
            crucial to any knowledge endeavor including the seeking of
            self-knowledge. At the next level of integration, the Unitive
            perspective, reality is understood as the undifferentiated
            phenomenological continuum or chaos, the creative ground, &ldquo;das
            All,&rdquo; or whatever other terms human beings have created to
            express this awareness of an underlying unity.
          </p>

          <p>
            In summary, one of the main existential concerns of men and women at
            these two most mature stages of ego development is to deal with the
            fundamental assumptions about human nature and one&rsquo;s need to
            make order out of the chaos as well as the need of the ego to create
            a story about what it means to be alive and why one&rsquo;s
            existence matters.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Four reminders of how Ego Development Theory frames reality in its
            own Western- flavored way.
          </h3>

          <p>
            First, because of the statistical rarity of these two stages and the
            method of creating ED theory based on the evidence from sentence
            completions, their formulation and descriptions are more tentative
            than those up to the Strategist stage. On the other hand, their
            likelihood has been confirmed in several dissertation studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, in observing and dialoguing with individuals who tested at
            these rarer, most developed ego stages, we found that there are many
            more ways to embody them than earlier worldviews. This makes culling
            the essential features of these stages much more challenging. It is
            also harder to identify who should be considered fully functioning
            from these later perspectives and who shows occasional signs of them
            but has not yet made them their meaning making home base.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third, the whole theory was developed based on a Western cultural
            premise. It was verbally tested with individuals for whom English is
            either a first or a very fluent second language. Where feasible,
            translators who were highly sensitive to nuances in both the first
            and the second language were employed. Nonetheless, there are forms
            of meaning making especially in remote areas of the world and in
            languages that are less linear than English that fall outside this
            framework and cannot be readily examined by duplicating the sentence
            completion method.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, I like to restate the conclusion of my dissertation (1999)
            that the Unitive stage is a catch-all stage for the ego transcendent
            realm of human development. Further study and using different
            methods of exploration will likely lead to further differentiations
            and insights into the nature of unitive understanding. Clearly such
            subtle distinctions already exist both in Ancient Eastern texts as
            well as in the eyes of Western observers (Brown and Engler, 1978).
            It is regrettable that the inherent limitations of the radical
            empirical method I adopted from Loevinger does not render such
            information. Terri O&rsquo;Fallon (2010) has recently attempted to
            refine and extend the conception of the postautonomous stages by
            Wilber&rsquo;s AQAL model as a scaffold and reinterpreting the
            distinction between stages and states of consciousness based on her
            research and experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Few earlier explorers of meaning making have tried to conceptualize
            the frame of mind of individuals who go beyond a systems view, most
            notably H. Koplowitz (1984).
          </p>

          <p>
            Koplowitz defined reality as an undivided unity, or undifferentiated
            phenomenological continuum, without boundaries and time-space
            distinctions. It is this same cohesive reality that A. Korzybski
            (1948) referred to as the overall &ldquo;territory&rdquo; existing
            prior to human mapping. He warned generations of scholars not to
            confuse the territory with the maps we are making of it. To be able
            to think about reality as an undifferentiated whole &ndash; even if
            only as a thought experiment &ndash; is important for understanding
            the phenomenon of late stage development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Genesis in the Old Testament provides a telling example of the
            general mechanism of the progres- sive segmentation and
            differentiation of the undivided whole. The creation myth identifies
            some basic categories of human experience in order of their
            appearance: From heaven and earth (above and below), to day and
            night (light and dark) to animate and inanimate (alive and
            not-alive; moving and stationary) etc., to the final arrival of
            humans and with them more abstract, non sensory-based concepts, such
            as the &ldquo;naming&rdquo; of the animals, and the prohibition to
            eat from the tree of &ldquo;knowledge of good and evil.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall language can be conjectured to have evolved via progressive
            elaboration throughout history and repeatedly in different cultures.
            The creation story is but one example of how new segmentations and
            differentiations are made as the need arises. It is by naming the
            distinctions we make, that we eventually create the complex world of
            our lives full of things, events and ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding this process, allows people to see through their
            tendency to reify reality and the self and to feel most alive and
            genuine in an indeterminate process of witnessing, and ultimately of
            being without the need to defend any particular kind of experience.
            Certainty and uncertainty merge as one feels at home in not knowing
            and yet open to fully experiencing whatever enters consciousness.

            The Construct-aware and Ego-aware Stage 5/6 (Magician, Alchemist)

          <p>
            Time frame + Embrace: Beyond own lifetime; global- historical
            perspective; multicultural awareness and appreciation of completely
            different ways of living and making sense of life.
          </p>

            Cognition: Complex interaction of nested systems;

          </p>

          <p>
            Preoccupation: Inner conflict around existential paradoxes, the
            habits of the mind and heart &amp; intrinsic problems with language
            and meaning making in the discursive mode.
          </p>

          <p>
            Positive expression: Accepting paradox and ambiguity, committed to
            serving self and others with humility in the face of our existential
            predicament as mortals needing maps and yearning to matter and make
            a difference.
          </p>

          <p>
            Truth: In the personal, rational, symbol-mediated realm of meaning
            making one is always separated from non-duality, no matter what
            level of abstraction and of insight one gains. Truth via
            representational understanding is always partial, perspectival, geo-
            and anthropocentric.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Construct-aware and the Ego-aware Stage 5/6 is the final
            observed differentiation in the sequence of overall differentiation
            or separation from a previous worldview on the path to an ever
            greater integration or union. Unfortunately, the
            &ldquo;professional&rdquo; labels that have been used or suggested
            for this stage -- Magician, Alchemist, Crone, Jester etc. -- are all
            inadequate to express the varieties and depth of understanding, this
            level is able to gain. The professional labels tend to reflect
            behavioral aspects of this stage that are not shared by all of its
            representatives
          </p>

          <p>
            As a stage of differentiation, the 5th person perspective again
            questions everything that seemed to hold true and be certain up to
            this point. Indeed, an all- pervasive uncertainty is one of the
            characteristics of this stage. The suffering that can accompany this
            feeling of groundlessness is sometimes described as the dark night
            of the soul or in the existentialist French literature as &ldquo;no
            way out.&rdquo; This level, like others, becomes the home base for
            some individuals and its very fluidity and uncertainty can become a
            source of &eacute;lan vital and relish. It is precisely in the
            tension between polar opposites that the most active engagement with
            life is experienced. Overall the first postautonomous stage reflects
            taking a further perspective on what went on before. Magicians are
            stepping back and observing meaning making from an even higher
            altitude and from a broader purview of what it is to be a human
            being than prior levels. This includes comparing and integrating
            multiple systems and paradigms. It also includes realizing our human
            need for map making and trying to organize experience and knowledge
            into ever more complex matrices and metatheories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Evidence from the SCT indicates that for some adults the search for
            an integrated, enduring self- identity is superseded by a more
            immediate, fluid and process-oriented self-view. It seems that the
            systems view of reality can give way to a more flexible,
            continuously deconstructing, non-reified notion of self in a rare
            transformation beyond it. In his current interpretation of the fifth
            order of consciousness, Kegan (1994), for instance, describes adults
            at his interindividual or self-transforming order of consciousness
            as having such a process-oriented experience of the self. As soon as
            one becomes aware of one&rsquo;s need to reify experience and tell a
            good self-story with a permanent self as its main actor, one
            deconstructs any such identification.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have found it useful to distinguish between two forms of
            embodying this stage: a) The Construct-aware and b) the Ego-aware.
            Both are expressions of meaning making in the personal, rational and
            symbolically mediated realm of awareness. I originally named the 5th
            person perspective as the Construct-aware stage because becoming
            aware of the constructed nature of reality it is one of the most
            salient characteristics of this stage distinguishing it from prior
            stages. However, given new data and my observations of people over
            30 years, I find that overall more people fit into the Ego-aware
            perspective than into the Construct-aware one. I thus now prefer to
            call the stage itself Ego-aware, and to distinguish more clearly
            between the two expressions. Some individuals seem to be more alert
            to the experience of living life in a fundamental quandary of
            questioning their own questioning and seeking while others focus
            more on the construction of meaning and the language conundrum.
          </p>

          <p>
            My theoretical hunch is that construct-awareness comes somewhat
            earlier on board in meaning making than ego awareness. A tenet of
            constructive developmental theory itself, namely that a certain
            level of cognition is necessary but not sufficient for stage
            development, seems to confirm this sequencing. In addition, if the
            hypothesis is valid that the ego is valiantly trying to create a
            coherent narrative about our existence and about the world, a last
            ditch attempt to create the most comprehensive maps possible would
            be one expression of this need at the Construct-aware level. On the
            one hand, it looks like becoming aware of the construction of
            meaning comes earlier than being aware of the ego&rsquo;s
            fundamental needs and efforts at meaning creation. Personality
            differences as well as prior training may play a role in this
            distinction. Thus I have even wondered whether construct-awareness
            as a rational approach to meaning making can be skipped in favor of
            going straight for ego- awareness and towards ego-transcendence.
            Based on this more recent hypothesis, I first describe the
            Construct-aware form of this level. Additional studies may help to
            confirm or disconfirm the sequence.
          </p>

          <h3>a) the Construct-aware expression of this stage:</h3>

          <p>
            The Construct-aware stage represents folks who are aware that
            meaning is constructed, invented, generated rather than inherent in
            things, events and concepts. At the same time, Construct&ndash;aware
            people try with great ingenuity and dedication to create super
            theories or multidimensional maps or tapestries of reality. They
            attempt to integrate whatever other theories they are aware of into
            an ever more complex and comprehensive theory of everything.50 Thus
            some Construct-aware individuals spend a lifetime creating such
            theories in order to provide the meta-perspectives or supermaps they
            feel are going to help themselves and others to better understand
            the complexity of human affairs. A chief indicator that we deal with
            such an endeavour is the extreme complexity of such theories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still others with the 5th person perspective begin to fathom the
            cognitive dimension of meaning making itself. They start to wonder
            about the meaningfulness of more and more complex thought structures
            and integrations such as can be imagined with a fifth or nth person
            perspective. Playing the complex numeric abstractions and formulas
            game is one way the ego can increase its sense of control and
            meaning. It also seems to please some individuals to demonstrate
            their capacity for mental gymnastics. Making the most of this talent
            and sharing it is a perfectly valuable contribution to the knowledge
            quest. But for those more interested in the quest for meaning, the
            simple question arises in the face of hypermentalism &ldquo;so
            what?&rdquo; How does ever more cognitive complexity serve our daily
            living and our understanding of the human condition? Some
            Construct-aware individuals therefore may also begin to realize the
            absurdity or automatic limits of human map making in the discursive,
            represen- tational domain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Becoming conscious of the futility of describing reality by ever
            more complex maps and approximations can lead individuals to suffer
            greatly as they experience the limits, but have no way to transcend
            them with the same rational means that have brought them to grasping
            this state of affairs. An altogether different relationship to
            knowing is necessary, one people often glimpse during meditation or
            other altered state experiences.
          </p>

          <h3>b) The Ego-aware expression of the 5th person perspective</h3>

          <p>
            In contrast to the Construct-aware insights, Ego-aware individuals
            tend to be people who have become aware of the pattern of
            development that encompasses an ever broader realm of experience,
            action, feelings and thought. Above all they may viscerally get the
            absurdity of trying to understand reality with the mind and via
            representational means alone. The 5th person perspective enables
            them to analyze both their own becoming and the evolving theories
            about their own becoming as well as to begin to notice the
            fundamental need for orienting frameworks or stories that are at the
            heart of all human meaning making across the globe regardless of
            culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            They realize that the &ldquo;ego&rdquo; has functioned both as a
            central processing unit for all incoming stimuli (ego as process)
            and as a central point of reference for self-identity formation (ego
            as representation) a distinction first introduced by Funk (1994). In
            light of the importance of this distinction, let me recapitulate the
            two distinct uses of the term &ldquo;ego&rdquo; in ego development.
            While the process of differentiation and integration is likely to
            continue all the way to a non-dual identity with the &ldquo;ground
            of being,&rdquo; ED Theory chronicles the nine transformations in
            self-identity that were deduced from analyzing sentence completions.
            In general, the self-identifications described by ego stages follow
            a pattern of increasing flexibility, choice and non-defensiveness as
            individuals mature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once human beings realize the fundamental function of the ego to
            create a sense of permanence and saliency, they may experience their
            full and inevitable ego-centricity. As long as one operates in the
            rational, language mediated realm, there is no escape from this
            insight. Having an ego which craves clear boundaries and
            significance and unceasingly tries to create them is now often felt
            as a constraint to further growth and understanding. When the ego
            becomes transparent to itself, it may well desire ego transcendence,
            but the very attachment to detachment creates the paradoxical
            situation of exacerbating the attachment. The more one tries to move
            beyond with greater effort, the more one gets stuck. Noticing and
            experiencing such existential dilemmas is common at this stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike the more cognitively-oriented people with the 5th person
            perspective, Ego-aware individuals focus more on the ego&rsquo;s
            clever and vigilant machinations at self-preservation by creating
            the illusion of a permanent self-identity. Final knowledge about the
            self or anything else is seen as illusive and unattainable through
            effort and reason because all conscious thought, all cognition is
            recognized as constructed and, therefore, split off from the
            underlying, cohesive, non-dual territory. Even such a concept as
            &ldquo;ego&rdquo; or &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; become now questionable.
            What is the ego other than a term we have created in order to
            explore and communicate a kind of experience in the West that is
            shared and utterly human. To what degree is this concept necessary
            and useful and in which way is it reifying experience to a degree
            that prevents us from fully being alive and open to experience
            without linguistic filters?
          </p>

          <p>
            By turning further inward, Ego-aware persons start to see through
            their own attempts at meaning making. They become aware of the
            profound splits and paradoxes inherent in discursive thought. In
            many ways, they individually rediscover the Korzybski&rsquo;s notion
            that &ldquo;the map is not the territory.&rdquo; Only this time,
            this realization is not just an interesting piece of received
            knowledge, it constitutes a vital and often temporarily painful
            aspect of consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many find it fascinating to explore the linguistic process of naming
            aspects of reality by splitting experience into polar opposites as
            vividly portrayed in Genesis. The splitting is accompanied by
            automatic and socially supported value judgments about what is
            desirable and what is not.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the last half century, constructive developmental theory has
            contributed much to refine this observation. What is considered to
            be desirable and what is not depends on the cultural context as well
            as on the level of consciousness. The interconnected nature of
            concepts only becomes obvious at the postconventional stages and
            then with increasing sharpness and clarity. Concepts makes sense
            only in conjunction with their surround and their polar opposite.
            Good and evil, life and death, beauty and ugliness are now
            recognized as two sides of the same coin. They mutually necessitate
            and define each other. While polarities as used in polarity dynamics
            can be understood as pairs of interdependent values at earlier
            levels, here, a deeper understanding of the discursive
            conceptualizations and abstractions is sinking in, namely how these
            are created in the first place. Moreover, some Ego-aware individuals
            can become aware how the constant and automatic judging habit of
            what is good and what is not creates much of the unhappiness and
            striving for betterment so prevalent in ordinary waking
            consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, Ego-aware individuals have a dynamic and multi-faceted
            understanding of human nature and the complexities of human
            interaction. They want to face their own profound need for theories
            and explanations. They hope to unearth the limits of the rational
            mind, and to unlearn their automatic, conditioned responses based on
            memory, acquired distinctions of what is good and bad through
            continuous, everyday cultural reinforcement. They are also aware of
            the habits of the heart, of our seeking for self-understanding and
            compassion for others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego-aware individuals start to pay attention to their own emotional
            and rational processing patterns. To watch oneself trying to make
            sense is intriguing and absorbing and can become all- consuming.
            Living at the edge of meaning and meaninglessness can be
            exhilarating at times and frustrating at others. Whether individuals
            at this level focus more on the liberating aspects of their
            awareness or more on the disillusionment and sense of loss that come
            with this mindset probably depends on many factors: among them
            personality type, the company of understanding others, and general
            life circumstances. Ego-aware individuals begin to notice how
            fleeting and recursive thoughts and feelings can be. They may
            observe how these follow ingrained patterns of repetition that are
            not amenable to conscious effort at overcoming them. &ldquo;Here my
            ego goes again despite knowing better&rdquo; is the refrain often
            mentioned in Ego-aware sentence completions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this new level of insight can be quite
            disconcerting and confusing. It&rsquo;s like the bottom of the
            barrel has fallen out. Now there is truly no place to stand on. One
            must learn to live in the tension of the paradox that as a human
            being one must embrace one&rsquo;s need for meaning while,
            simultaneously, understanding the futility of such an endeavour.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego-aware folks may come to feel that the automatic judgment habit
            that constitutes much of ordinary functioning as a major barrier to
            deeper self-acceptance and embrace of others. They observe the
            habits of mind such as the tendency to endlessly analyze and reflect
            in order to create ever more accurate theories of life and nature.
            All of these endeavors can now be understood as partial defenses
            against knowing the impermanence of the embodied self. Thus, at the
            Ego-aware stage not just cultural conditioning is seen through, but
            the predicament of living in language.
          </p>

          <p>
            When people see through the filter of the symbolic construction and
            mapping of reality, their disposition towards the language habit can
            change profoundly. In general, Ego-aware individuals try to remain
            aware of the pseudo-reality created by words. They realize that the
            pursuit of objective self- identification and rational, objective
            explanations of the universe are futile--artifacts of our need to
            make permanent and substantive that which is in flux, immaterial,
            and impermanent. To reiterate a crucial point, the language habit
            works to support the ego&rsquo;s supremacy whenever we make meaning
            through representations regardless of the specific tongue, power
            base, or cultural or personal context. At the same time, Ego-aware
            adults appreciate the vital function language plays in human affairs
            and growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the process of self-awareness deepens and reasoning becomes
            further differentiated for individuals at the 5th person
            perspective, access to intuition, bodily states, feelings, dreams,
            archetypal and other transpersonal material increases. More than
            that, these sources of knowledge can become as important as rational
            deliberation for making sense of experience and for finding meaning
            in life. Indeed, the capacity to draw from and appreciate insights
            from non-rational sources of information increases throughout
            postconventional development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, the more regular practice of turning inward and
            observing one&rsquo;s own mental processes also often leads to the
            spontaneous experience of a direct mode of being in which knower and
            known momentarily merge, and the personal self-sense disappears.
            These states are variously called peak moments, flow states, or
            bliss experiences. A. Maslow (1971) and M. Czikszentmihalyi (1990)
            give excellent profiles of the nature and consistently positive
            qualities of these states. I am not saying here that all contact
            with the numinous is blissful, only that flow states tend to be so,
            and thus, beckon the traveler to yearn for more such experiences.
            The process of dismantling the vestiges of the conditional self can
            also be harrowing as described in alternative states of
            consciousness entered through other means such as drugs or devoted
            meditation practices. Best known text in the West for that
            elucidates the confrontation with one&rsquo;s demons is the Tibetan
            Book of the Dead.52 The conscious experience of non-ordinary states
            of consciousness in peak experiences -- where one loses track of
            self and time -- helps to put in perspective the self&rsquo;s
            temptation for an exaggerated sense of power and agency and offers
            an alternative way of experiencing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego-aware individuals report more often than people at earlier
            stages that they are watching or witnessing the parades of thoughts
            and feelings come and go without trying to direct them. Thus, they
            experience moments of freedom from the ego&rsquo;s constant efforts
            at control and self-affirmation. Yet, at this stage, such
            experiences are short-lived. As soon as one evaluates and judges
            them, the magic is broken.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are naturally reluctant to relinquish our familiar mode of
            functioning. We do not want to give up the illusion of our enduring
            separate identity, which we so laboriously learned to define,
            cultivate, and rely on for most of our conscious lives. Even if we
            understand that letting go of our attachment to the known will bring
            freedom from familiar kinds of suffering, attempts at doing so are
            ineffective and often lead to intractable paradoxes. The more one
            becomes attached to the idea of non-attachment, the more firmly one
            remains fettered. The more one is conscious and proud of one&rsquo;s
            psychic powers and ego- transcending quest, the more clearly
            one&rsquo;s ego is still enthroned. C. Trungpa (1987) in Cutting
            Through Spiritual Materialism has perhaps given the most cogent and
            concise analysis of how the ego can usurp transpersonal episodes for
            its own self-perpetuation and glorification.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is a fact of life for persons at the 5th person perspective that
            there are few other people like them. They may fear that almost
            nobody understands them in their complexity and can sympathize with
            their experience. Fearing this, they wonder whether they are
            culpable of hubris, of feeling &ldquo;better&rdquo; than others.
            They also observe their own self-attachment and their need for a
            permanent self-identity by means of ever more comprehensive
            self-theories. On the other hand, they truly appreciate
            others&rsquo; need to make sense of their lives within their own
            means, values and mindsets. They therefore have a much deeper
            toleration for others&rsquo; solution to life without being blind to
            the possible shortcomings and limitations of such solutions.
            Sometimes Ego-aware folks express a sense of envy at the simplicity
            of earlier periods because their own world is experienced as so
            complex. However, given their ego maturity, most are capable of
            arriving at a dynamic and hopeful balance within these fundamental
            conflicts: They fulfill their perceived or chosen destiny
            independently and courageously in full realization of their basic
            despair and aloneness. When they cannot integrate this awareness,
            their depression is about man&rsquo;s essential aloneness and
            inability to create lasting meaning through the rational enterprise.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ego-aware individuals represent the first stage that looks at all
            experience fully in terms of ongoing fluctuations. In terms of
            theory, one builds edifices of knowledge and dismantles them as soon
            as they are erected. In terms of the heart, one may feel any emotion
            and then question its very validity and appropriateness as soon as
            it is felt or expressed. Ego-aware people are therefore even more
            sensitive than Autonomous persons regarding the well-being of others
            and capable of understanding them in compassionately in
            developmental as well as in psycho-dynamic terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            When people with a postautonomous perspective choose to work in the
            public, they often rely on their fine-tuned interpersonal skills and
            insight into others&rsquo; complex and dynamic personalities. As
            leaders, they tend to build their own novel organizations or work
            alone doing what they perceive to be their best contribution to
            humanity. Some like to take on the roles of catalysts or
            transformers in organizations, but readily leave these when they
            feel their transformational work is done. They feel successful when
            they have made themselves dispensable, that is, if the organization
            itself has become transformative and self-organizing. In groups and
            organizations, they may notice archetypal and group process patterns
            that elude other observers. They may understand larger group forces
            and castings of individuals in the human drama, that the lead actors
            themselves are not aware of. As consultants and mentors, they can
            optimally adjust their engagement style to their clients&rsquo;
            personality and developmental needs: They can let them find their
            own way within their own means through empathetic listening,
            skillfully challenging set ideas, and helping them reframe their
            experience. They can support people in telling new self-stories, and
            gain courage to experiment with the boundaries of their current way
            of meaning making.
          </p>

          <p>
            As therapists and coaches, they can listen to others&rsquo;
            listening and meaning making and be with them in an deeply empathic
            manner. They often offer transformational, non-distorted and
            creative feedback and practices to support their clients. They have
            access to their own earlier ways of meaning making in a much deeper
            and more effective way than people at the other postconventional
            stages. This allows them to freely tailor their interactions to the
            needs of those they interact with. Thus, Ego-aware individuals may
            have access to supporting Self-protective persons by dealing with
            them on their own level, unilaterally asserting their superiority
            and power.53 Unlike earlier levels, they are less concerned with
            success and rewards for their efforts. Sowing seeds that may take a
            long time to germinate if at all, is part of what one does because
            om can do no other.
          </p>

          <p>
            As coaches and therapists, they do not presume that they can fully
            understand the experience of other people in their uniqueness while
            they feel an affinity with them on a human level. The 5th person
            frame of mind with its deep questioning of meaning making is open to
            not-knowing that no previous stage can fathom. It provides a
            constant level of awe and wonder about being a human being and the
            mystery of consciousness development. In light of this, a good
            indicator that someone is able to look at himself and others&rsquo;
            from this altitude is a profound humility about the limits of
            knowing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Ego-aware individuals may, on the other hand, resent the very
            self-importance and sense of knowing exhibited by many Strategists
            with their air of certainty, subtle expression of self-satisfaction,
            and their burning desire to help others to self-actualize and become
            more integral and enlightened. They see the temptation to view
            oneself as the summit of human understanding and/or as a valid
            measure of what is possible and the desire for others to be
            different than they are as a basic shadow in change agents at
            earlier stages. In many ways, Blaire Pascal answered his question of
            &ldquo;what is man?&rdquo; in his essay Pens&eacute;es (~1661) in a
            way that described the experience of the ego-aware person cogently.
            He said, and I paraphrase, &ldquo;Man is nothing compared to
            infinity, and an infinity compared to nothingness.&rdquo; While
            Strategists hang out on the infinity side of this equation and
            relish the sense of power and knowledge they have gained,
            Ego&ndash;aware individuals may sit in the tension of the two
            opposing perspectives, and vacillate between them. Some find most
            affirmation in knowing that so little of substance is knowable, and
            relish the mystery of being.
          </p>

          <p>
            As highly differentiated individuals, some may be over-critical of
            themselves when they first become aware of their ego-attachment.
            With practice of experiencing one&rsquo;s attachment to having an
            ego with ego needs and letting it go, Ego-aware individuals can
            become tolerant of themselves in their vacillating complexity. They
            generally use mature defenses (sublimation, non-hostile humor,
            bracketing out) as they become aware and insightful about their own
            foibles and defense styles. No longer do strong emotions need to be
            recast as positive aspects of the self. They can now be
            spontaneously expressed in their unmitigated form because the need
            to defend and look good has lifted. One is much more free to be who
            one is including revealing one&rsquo;s emotions, vulnerabilities,
            and confusions. In the best scenario, this self-revealing openness
            can model to others that being vulnerable connects one to the very
            humanity of others. There is no pride in one&rsquo;s actions, only
            the compassionate offering of the wounded healer.
          </p>

          <p>
            To summarize, Postautonomous meaning seekers are capable of
            perceiving the structure of their own thinking and feeling habits,
            comparing them to that of others and discovering the fundamental
            limitations of all rational thought and the limits of language.
            Usually they come across as very bright, but often impatient with
            their own cleverness as they see it as just that. They are intrigued
            by the human need for meaning making and its ubiquitous expression
            across time and the known world. They understand for the first time
            the underlying process of how such meaning is constructed through
            the invention-construction of ever more complex theories. These are
            based on the segmentation and reification of the underlying flux of
            phenomena. Thus they are often preoccupied with the limits of
            discursive meaning making and with learning how to live with the
            existential paradox of being a mortal yearning for significance and
            immortality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conscious preoccupation: The limits of rational thought and
            language, and living in the tension of the consciously insolvable
            problem of existence and non-existence, life and death.
          </p>

          <p>
            Counseling style: Ability to adjust style to clients: mentoring,
            letting others find their own way within their own means through
            empathetic listening, challenging ideas, helping them reframe their
            experience depending on where they are in their development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depression: Despair about man&rsquo;s essential aloneness and
            inability to create lasting meaning through the rational enterprise.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chief anxiety: Fearing that almost nobody understands them in their
            complexity and sympathizes with their experience, and that by
            fearing this, they are culpable of hubris. Concomitant with feeling
            not appreciated or understood can be a deep sense of loneliness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: The language of Construct-aware people is often
            complex, vivid, authentic and playful. It is more direct, sometimes
            rawer than that of Autonomous persons&rsquo; because there is far
            less need to show one&rsquo;s best side, to impress as at previous
            stages. Construct-aware people express a vast matrix of topics,
            concerns, questions, insights and commentary cleverly united into a
            complex sentence structure. Responses that have a
            stream-of-consciousness quality, or thought-in-progress mode belong
            here as do expressions of one&rsquo;s attempt to let go of conscious
            structuring. Vivid expressions about the constructed nature of
            reality occur at this stage as well as fundamental questions about
            meaning making as a defense, concern with issues of definition, and
            epistemology.

            ### The Unitive stage 6 The cosmic, ego-transcendent or witnessing
            perspective
          </p>

          <p>
            In the sequence of ego development and the growth of self-awareness,
            this is the last step in the sequence of differentiation and
            integration we were able to discern. From the ancient wisdom
            literature to recent research in higher stages of consciousness,
            there is evidence of many more stages beyond the rational,
            symbolically-mediated personal realm of meaning making. How many
            such stages exists depends on the literature consulted and the
            criteria by which stages are defined. The scarcity of data collected
            with the MAP testing method did not allow me to make any finer
            distinctions in the ego- transcendent realm. Consequently, my
            description of the Unitive stage likely confounds several distinct
            higher levels of consciousness into one catch-all level. Still, the
            characteristics were carefully taken from actual utterances from
            individuals who expressed a novel perspective only possible from a
            paradigm shift from a personal to a trans-personal or immediate
            witnessing capacity.
          </p>

          <p>
            It seems that the Unitive stage presents an entirely new way of
            perceiving human existence and experience of consciousness. The term
            witnessing (rather than observing) can be used here to describe the
            capacity of people at this stage to metabolize experience without
            the conscious, willed focus and preoccupations of other adult
            stages. The Truth is imminent in the universe and can be apprehended
            in this ready, open-process stance, but it cannot be grasped by
            rational means and by making an effort. Unitive individuals
            therefore seem to transcend narrow ego-boundaries. They have open
            boundaries and are attuned to rather than preoccupied with whatever
            enters awareness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Individuals at this level are now able to witness the whole song and
            dance of prior ways of understanding and meaning making with
            compassion and equanimity. They understand the need of the personal
            ego to ensure a sense of permanence and substantiality while at the
            same time recognizing the illusion of this desire for permanence.
            The previous way of viewing reality solely from the self&rsquo;s
            perspective and through the medium of language is transformed. The
            new paradigm has a universal or cosmic perspective as an organizing
            principle and as a steady place from which meaning is derived. It is
            non-centered in the ego although the ego is available as a
            perspective when useful. Unlike state experiences that gave people
            glimpses of mystical or unitive experiences, now these are steadily
            available in the witnessing stance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unitive individuals experience themselves and others as part of
            ongoing humanity, embedded in the creative ground, fulfilling the
            destiny of evolution. The two sides of the Pascalian paradox are
            integrated: feelings of belongingness and feelings of one&rsquo;s
            separateness and uniqueness are experienced without undue tension.
            They are simply changing perceptions of the unending possibilities
            of being. At this level of integration, adults can look at
            themselves and at other beings in terms of the passing of ages, of
            near and far in geographical, social, cultural, historical,
            intellectual and developmental dimensions. They can take multiple
            points of view and shift focus effortlessly among many states of
            awareness. They feel embedded in nature - birth, growth and death,
            joy and pain - are seen as natural occurrences - patterns of change
            in the flux of time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consciousness or rational awareness is no longer perceived as a
            shackle, but as just another phenomenon that assumes foreground or
            background status depending on one&rsquo;s momentary attention.
            Persons at the Unitive stage can see a world in a grain of sand,
            that is, they can perceive the concrete, limited, and temporal
            aspects of an entity simultaneously with its eternal and symbolic
            meaning. Because of this unitive ability (Maslow, 1971, p. 111) they
            can cherish the humanness in the seemingly most undifferentiated
            beings and feel at one with them. They respect the essence in others
            and therefore do not need them to be different than they are. It is
            important to realize that from a unitive point of view, later stages
            are not better than earlier ones because all are necessary parts of
            interconnected reality and the overall evolutionary process. Unitive
            thinkers also accept themselves &ldquo;as is&rdquo; in a
            non-controlling way. No matter how great their achievements may be,
            they are aware that these are only a drop in the pool of ongoing
            human endeavors. Sensitive others are often struck by the humility
            and grace that they experience in the presence of Unitive
            individuals. Being down-to-earth (simplicity on the other side of
            complexity) can be one of the most salient differences between
            postconventional ego stages and transpersonal ways of meaning
            making.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, Individuals at this most mature ego stage may be
            perceived as &ldquo;aloof,&rdquo; as not enough engaged in the
            goals, pursuits, concerns of common humanity especially from the
            perspective of individuals at the Self-conscious and Conscientious
            stages 3/4 and 4. Even early postconventional people may be
            suspicious of this kind of &ldquo;togetherness or
            groundedness.&rdquo; What is not evident to these critics is that
            Unitive adults often act as catalysts in shaping others&rsquo;
            lives. In being what they are without excuses, they challenge
            others&rsquo; perspectives, and demonstrate a way of being human
            that is different from the evaluative, conventional ideas about what
            it means to be an adult. They manifest a deeper security about being
            than is possible with a rationally generated self-identity. In
            contrast to all other stages, Unitive individuals seems to have
            intense, non-demanding relationships with people regardless of their
            development, age, gender, or any other identifications. Because they
            see the dignity in all manifestations of life, others feel worthy
            and whole in their presence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unitive persons have a completely internalized transpersonal or
            interindividual morality. Inner conflicts and conflicting external
            demands simply are part of being and need not be resolved or denied,
            only witnessed. They are no longer driven by desires to be one way
            or another, to achieve one state or another. Instead they can let go
            of the unattainable and rest in the experience of being. They are
            concerned with global justice, spontaneity, existence &amp;
            creativity but create no undue tension around goal achievement.
            Rather than being passive, the non-attached, impersonal stance
            allows for greater and more direct and powerful action where action
            is needed. Non-attachment to outcomes is an essential and liberating
            aspect of witnessing and acting out of non-defensive, spontaneous
            insight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reality is now regularly experienced as the undifferentiated
            phenomenological continuum or the creative ground of unified
            consciousness. Every object, word, thought, feeling and sensation,
            every theory is understood as a human construct: separating out,
            creating boundaries where there are none. The quest for meaning and
            connection is an essential aspect of the human condition. Giving
            names to experience and making distinctions is necessary for human
            growth, study, interaction and communication, but at the source
            there is nothing to distinguish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stage 6 individuals feel interconnected with others as all sentient
            beings struggle to survive and make sense of their existence.
            Persons at the Unitive stage feel tolerance, compassion and an
            affiliation with all manifestations of life. The simplest flatworm
            is in some way as close to the truth as the most sophisticated
            thinker. Peak experiences no longer have an out-of-this-world
            quality, they have become a familiar way of being and experiencing.
            They form the ground and are no longer &ldquo;peak.&rdquo;. From
            moment to moment only the present is real. Radical openness releases
            individuals to be in tune with goodness, truth and beauty and to
            relish them wherever they are present which is everywhere. They have
            visionary experiences, that is, they comprehend things in a
            holistic, analog way in addition to apprehending them through the
            filter of the personal ego.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unitive perceivers can shift focus without effort and behold the
            whole simultaneously with its constituting variables. They operate
            within an expanded time frame which includes all of earth&rsquo;s
            history and its future as a part of this moment. Life is seen as a
            form of temporary and sometimes voluntary separation (Bodhisattva
            vow) from the creative ground to which it will always return and of
            which it is a unique manifestation. Though adults at the Unitive
            stage are aware of themselves as separate and unique embodiments,
            they also identify with all other living beings. The separation of
            self from others is experienced as an illusion, an invention to
            safeguard the ego&rsquo;s need for permanence and self- importance
            and to defend against the fear of its death.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unitive adults have an integrated sense of a unique identity as
            participants in the evolution of the cosmos. They are in tune with
            their precious &ldquo;life&rsquo;s work&rdquo; as a simultaneous
            expression of their unique selves and as part of one&rsquo;s shared
            humanity. They also care about the fundamental dilemma of the human
            condition. They work for justice, fairness, and benevolence towards
            all. Though taking responsibility for meaning making, they
            don&rsquo;t perceive themselves to be the sole and lone masters of
            their souls as envisioned by Autonomous individuals and to some
            degree Construct-aware people. Ways of being are infinite. Clues for
            the variety of possibilities of being are offered by the study of
            human history, by our current experience of human diversity and
            likely with new forms of being human evolving in the future, in
            nature, and in alternative, non-waking states of consciousness. Life
            can appear as fulfilling a cosmic purpose and therefore it is
            essentially simple. Doing or thinking are just modes of existing,
            but not intrinsically more valuable than feeling, being or
            non-being. The last is probably the most difficult idea to grasp by
            most people who have not developed beyond the personal realm. As a
            Buddhist percept warns: Understanding is the ultimate illusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            To summarize, Unitive adults are more likely to have a balanced,
            integrated sense of both their belongingness and separateness as
            individuals because they feel part of the ongoing evolution of the
            universe in all its aspects and cycles of creation, destruction, and
            recreation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language clues: Unitive individuals use a global array of topics and
            concerns which are sometimes expressed within one response. They
            have a vast mental space to roam in because of the unitive ability.
            Kaleidoscopic responses bridge different levels and types of
            contrasts: concrete--practical; theoretical-- philosophical;
            personal--global; serious--humorous; physical--psychological&ndash;
            metaphysical , mundane and sublime. Unitive responses to the MAP may
            have unique and vivid expressions, or creative metaphors to express
            the ordinary and non-ordinariness, the bane and joy of existence.
            Occasionally one finds very simple responses in Unitive MAP
            protocols. Although rated at face-value, this is not
            counter-indicative as spontaneity and straightforward simplicity is
            an essential element of wisdom and ego-transcendence. While
            Construct-aware meaning makers have the most complex and richly
            differentiated view of reality in the personal realm, Unitive adults
            stand outside the &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; need for meaning making
            common to all earlier stages seeing as they do the non-necessity to
            shield and bolster the non-essential ego identifications.

          <h3>Summary:</h3>

          <p>
            Above I have outlined one possible path from the unconscious,
            undifferentiated symbiosis of the newborn to the conscious
            experience of embeddedness in the universe of mature adults. I have
            tried to chronicle the development of the self from prerational to
            metarational and from preverbal ignorance (= not knowing) to
            beginning postsymbolic wisdom and witnessing. Much freedom is gained
            when people realize the essential inter-connectedness of all
            phenomena and the constructed aspects of boundaries, objects, our
            self-identities and our stories about life and nature. Much
            suffering is alleviated when the automatic habits of mind and heart
            are unlearned and uncoupled from memory (what was) and desires (what
            ought to be) and replaced by mindful, non-evaluative attention to
            what is - now.
